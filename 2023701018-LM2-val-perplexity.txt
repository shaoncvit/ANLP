the count was silent but continued to gaze around	200.67

if your friend remains another week in my cellar shall be ruined	438.97
save me oh no said he but help me to die if you	66.27
bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing	279.10
candle of coarse tallow on black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less	507.18

cannot believe continued felton in voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this	309.95
then he said to himself must put this to the test but without compromising	390.01
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study	241.02
dead dead groaned forth villefort in paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that	204.38

gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there the enemy	1008.49
well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search	381.82
ah you philosophize replied villefort moment silence during which like wrestler who encounters powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you had nothing else to do should seek more amusing	1213.90
the mother and daughter passed the night	620.46
he started on seeing the cavalier with the	134.74
with word artagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais	195.40
you asked for candor and you have	290.88
but artagnan was not of character to allow man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule	177.13
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the	167.02

days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in	745.89

bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not	226.39
well on the faith of	156.17

grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la	95.04
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of	208.17
he spoke italian like tuscan and spanish like castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villefort	313.34
yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am to act how can it be effected someone must be sent to the	118.92
lucien said the baroness assure you have no desire to sleep and that have thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing	132.92

here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was gloomy looking room separated by wall from the vault	1575.64
had valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young	223.41
said my good fellow that would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses	644.57
he pushed the door open and	146.97
as to aramis he dwelt in little lodging composed of boudoir an eating room and bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his	459.53
rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saint méran insist	128.38
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the	447.81

the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his	288.42
this room was occupied by dantès	340.65
and the next day	319.76
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey	323.60
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and	601.80
gentlemen will see the king this evening but as to you do not advise you to risk doing	83.31
ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make visit oh yes of course mouston nothing	401.90
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed	304.23
the tower of	398.71
third sigh from	794.10
in few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent	218.18

at this moment the landlord came	50.20
one alone is left to me but he is one of those known believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to	88.87
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing	321.72
the priest gazed on the person addressing him with long and searching gaze there even seemed disposition on his part to court similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with strong italian accent you are	442.26
what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yes	301.73
with the enmity of the	67.48
if it were not ridiculous to make display of our triumph said morrel would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to	307.50
so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting great millionaire or capricious	980.07
well what has this bandit to do with the order have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but very much doubt your returning by the	235.35
then taking paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	370.23
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is	176.53
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another	510.57
jean had struck three quarters past	1236.03
it was in fact small craft from dunkirk bound for	968.26
yes and	126.27
so much the worse had much rather you were french and myself also they would hate us both	420.24
you know bragelonne said athos never speak without	561.06
have with you for one throw said	151.56
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his	240.01
he must be	290.62
danglars nodded to signify that he was	234.69
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample	1874.65
why didn they search more vigilantly they would have found they have not found but they are on the	293.22
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue	223.73
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats observed cannon on the road saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon	103.38

well la ramee who is gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that shall try	674.77
ah if were in your place said	69.43
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room	145.07
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted	860.57
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking word without making	226.76
monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured	332.60
two royal pages were playing with	508.47
that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes	85.24

planchet turned and returned the	235.43
my mother replied the young princess cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont	124.64
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness but we must say farewell edmond and let us	185.96
haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me said	160.03
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite	277.70
but at the very moment when artagnan stretched out his hand to receive	52.96
how did you fare for my part ate but	376.49
really count you do nothing and have nothing like other	187.31
matters are going all	562.20
an opportunity will come replied	768.08
with the eagle glance of sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only gull hovering over the waves the sail of sloop which was directed toward the coast of	322.87
in the first place said milady it is possible may be deceived and that artagnan and his friends may really come to your	70.83
anne blushed and buried her face in her	121.85
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the	155.75
but that does not affect the	146.09
the vessel was very old to risk that said the	164.59
in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the	137.05
de saint méran death which took place on the first stage he left	178.99
mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed	307.56
he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of	250.80
from that moment the old man eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit	43.86
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at	192.25
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying	211.27
speak out my	124.41
this was the more so because bonacieux reflections were all rose	970.54
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in week and in three days there is to be grand feast betrothal	237.19
saw the executioner return into the king room change his clothes put on black hat and large cloak and	263.23
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty	267.52
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis	464.48
it is upon one higher placed than am that god has laid this	953.33
make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and will always consult upon our	370.56
lutheran say believe such is the case do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in	482.37

the popular banker found that it answered better than	753.10
my lord answered the gascon differ from monsieur herblay entirely as to the last point though agree with him on the	287.55
letters had been despatched	216.99
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with	155.82
well said franz this	49.52
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way	138.93
do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account beseech	186.51
the streets are full of armed men continued	377.90
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de	374.56
hope shall gain renée favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on	1369.19
artagnan looked with stupefaction at man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of king in the prosecution of his	198.33
on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the	665.99
what are you going to do asked	25.30
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this	268.50
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle	597.01
it must have been for his hide for the carcass is not worth eighteen	297.61
de monte	16.32
danglars raving threw himself on the goat	1127.53
oh my lord bishop he cried seizing juxon hands where is providence where is providence my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal	343.02
what was all you were showing	122.07

must have said the duke proof of his connection with	118.46
have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties retained the sense of my	267.71
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was	104.91
door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest	465.44
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just	109.37
the same expression	754.80
he is proud soul he is man by himself you are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you aramis said athos are you jesting no no dear friend state only what we all	241.93
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated have assassinated then and not executed am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with	319.81
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline one self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory	540.17
the rendezvous	1432.63
the safety of cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his	511.41
and with my grandfather consent shall fulfil the promise which have made	334.23

they had formed circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have	226.76

the prince looked at him with unspeakable	342.29
remember chapter	17276.28
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him small	404.56
had an affianced husband man whom loved and who loved me heart like yours felton man like	676.25
it was worn by my father loyal	414.54
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our	158.49
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian	227.86
what hundred thousand francs for fowl ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves come come this is very droll very amusing allow but as am very hungry pray allow me to	611.77
nothing is	74.90
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other	401.11
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by artagnan inventive	370.36
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have claim being almost one of the family and will give as many rendezvous of that kind as can find persons willing to accept	171.65
ten minutes labor the wall gave way and hole large enough to insert the arm was	457.00
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he	815.78
saved my child said morrel what do you mean yes saved saved see see said the young	106.66

linen and wine are both being warmed	1924.50
the woman selected gold chain worth about five louis and the husband pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen	1572.39
then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the	47.06
will write letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to	317.69
an instant porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon	161.65
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of rival	645.33
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged do indeed and this swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and	307.41
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and	345.23
now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall tell you the cause of all these stupidities it is because at your theatres by what at least could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of phial or suck the button of ring and fall dead	361.02
monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the	157.11
did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words did but they were uttered in the romaic	268.04
where is he there in the	85.05
don know what it	31.00
and yet notwithstanding these precautions remained for some time in terrible agitation of	450.18
grimaud meantime undid the means of	965.23
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately	98.86
now mousqueton he said hope you don mean to desert your master ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea	332.22
he approached	218.61
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech	1271.84
porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating shall follow up on my	257.02
finally milady stopped and bitter smile passed over her	204.76
what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my	904.91
cries of despair resounded on all	559.64
if took them and were detected should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs year so that should be great fool to run such risk for three	262.23
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence artagnan went straight to the residence of	102.74
it was at this moment artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor carriage and few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut	138.90
and if ever am reconciled with the court shall prove to you hope that remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names artagnan and porthos artagnan and	164.74
then you have nothing more to do here no everything is all right	132.41
milady breathed deep sigh and	1236.28
exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake	452.49
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat	207.04
saw the soldier shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for was fearful he might also see	245.12
and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition did not think that was the way of your	223.60
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again	150.50
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell	168.06

eleven clock had	397.56
what were you doing on that armchair asked	151.47
ah there another brave and excellent young	384.24
artagnan then saw musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his	259.70
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost	841.36
oh never make matches my dear prince it is my settled	665.63
what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill	227.28
but have no permission to shoot over this	332.24

valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her	166.74

the duke walked so fast that artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	286.14
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his	69.84
the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of musketeer wore an enormous cloak said	134.27
oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her	459.37

do we breakfast or dine must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle	203.43
will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command	272.68
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his	477.05
the young man then entered the apartment of	50.14

which would not prevent me said artagnan if knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him sharp turn vow that would voluntarily risk my head in doing	194.74

my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest	159.75
and madness have been nearly mad and you know the axiom bis in	769.20
danglars felt the irony and compressed his	343.72
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga	849.71
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	168.60
both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe	919.55
escape as lord de winter had thought milady wound was not	223.77
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man countenance for an	85.81
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe	342.18
am told it is delightful place it is	359.24
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed	232.42
now one evening when artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about quarter of league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching	257.12
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf said	94.49
oh oh he has grown good deal it seems to	217.25

this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of	142.19
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the	415.60

the procurator wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of	255.20

yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little	216.53
de morcerf it is providence which punishes	572.92
but be assured my dear monsieur artagnan that if had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than	172.93
letter yes read	390.38
de villefort fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden	64.81
héloïse de	25.07
vitray said he you will go with all speed to	74.46
we will accompany them only to little village in limousin lying between tulle and angouleme little village called roche	2329.50

dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly adore	261.07
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you man in	418.05
felton felt shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this	408.55
understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share	399.95
hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding	396.65
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing single word to	212.87
for heaven sake do not serve as conductor between that man and	638.35
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector voice called him to the visiting	133.74
and caught it mamma don you remember interposed edward and pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his	1777.82
yes murmured flamarens lowering his	784.57
ah said artagnan with smile you sell your productions at their weight in	214.56
at length he one day received letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving large sum of money by way of	266.00
it was long since he had any reason for his morning inspiration but he always slept all night	285.46
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for	114.20
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit pray you on my right hand on my left will place him who has ever been as brother to me pointing with soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the	291.41
everything goes as if in flowery	1551.57
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet	291.11
and why ah very well said artagnan see that you understand	156.97
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable	697.76
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere	361.62
at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows clap of thunder they heard knocking at the	164.25
well then cried artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the	222.52
gentlemen said he in tone strangely firm for servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances	638.35
besides what is required of young man in paris to speak its language tolerably to make good appearance to be good gamester and to pay in	250.68
the doctor was friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had	101.07
poor fools said athos emptying glass of excellent bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions all the same resumed he having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows but what the devil are you about aramis continued	504.22

so much the better come tell me his name remember that his name is all my	94.50

my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but	138.01
yes but all four together and without scratch which is	773.27
what do you say to thousand crowns artagnan pouted out his lower lip in most extraordinary	628.66
in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be	129.77
when they entered artagnan chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to	198.93
ah monsieur de comminges he	67.67
and king	3631.29
nevertheless promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that gave one rebel an	1388.76

count may suggest one idea to you	579.01
hello grimaud planchet mousqueton bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the	475.49
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his	215.77

besides to do all this time is necessary months years and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told	237.51

there only the price we are not agreed	222.93
the host	249.64
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring	133.36
no repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty	1386.83
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is matter of the place de	94.68
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to	176.13
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of	543.27
oh yes yes thank you with all my heart said valentine and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of	219.67

but do you wish to marry andrea my	58.81
ah ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by	257.89
by the bye he said think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving line for porthos and	233.46
in few minutes valentine re entered the garden	276.10
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted	784.62
oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame felton my brother my friend conjure you no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be	301.77
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at	670.94

take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be good	229.28
very well said milady and she resolutely entered the	128.86
really have you had vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity and with king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not thing to be	474.45

some gendarme he	1308.78
de tréville who held out his hand to him artagnan pressed it with respect mixed with	118.88
if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you	267.05
have brought away ten or twelve	738.29

if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not	198.20

athos opened it and began by drawing forth little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has superfluity of	481.10
the abbé herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis	461.59
saw him from the window madame he is young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de	211.84
coquenard chamber they were	1460.59
that wise not for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the master for the we may	245.58
and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the	613.19
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his	199.62
artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his	339.89
the king drew his sword and broke it on his	55.73
that is to the	68.43
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his was strictly	428.23
took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were real count he wouldn be so	300.16
confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they	220.53
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his	274.37
the hostess as she entered saw artagnan and uttered little cry whereupon artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her	383.94
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and	192.86
milady faltered artagnan and fainted second	1030.68
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read newspaper that today the rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of	499.00
thin and	3357.59
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and	1099.09
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed	98.33
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the	256.35
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon	271.88
and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in	357.97
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by	198.58
artagnan to wait shall have further need of	242.37
oh gentlemen cried athos be men be christians see death is depicted on his face ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse grant me this poor wretch	507.09
but to die for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die danglars resembled timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its	611.24
both had recently come into the	257.45
said my good gentleman have horse to sell	464.28
wish to be providence myself for feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and	268.51

true he replied and my protector is very	147.85
do you wish him to read it said	47.05
you will allow me to leave first then half an hour you can go away in your	51.87
do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king yes the idea was	214.23
the cry proceeded from the	441.96
according to the laws of dueling at that period artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he	164.76
and swear to you before god madame said artagnan that if am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me will die sooner than do anything that may compromise	210.01
let me look for this letter it must be with my title	130.71

we were speaking of suitable habitation for the count of monte	116.75
mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an all powerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining	400.02
see that shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano but also return to florence	234.10
wait whilst light the lamp said la carconte it is growing dark and there may be some	263.07
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate	185.75
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son	242.07
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than	396.15
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of artagnan hand the musketeer felt	378.62
not at	110.51
at least wait until the story has	929.97
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green	88.71
you have managed my affairs so well that ought to allow you all the time you require for your	89.45
had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the th of this month and the other half on the th of next	107.78
there they found brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down	469.30
was he young or old about six or seven and twenty years of age should	198.72
at the end of quarter of an hour faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where avrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in	158.92
alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my	96.20
come in	488.51
now said artagnan ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de	205.01

meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors	1071.33
breakfast the abbess came to pay her	155.60
are you hurt sir coldly asked	529.43
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women	383.74
scarron and raoul	752.32
the evening arrived all paris was in	478.36
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at	104.04
what without passports he	1585.08
on the summit of rising ground little in advance of the enemy appeared short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by	363.18
means for classical tragedy moment of silence employed by milady in observing the young man who listened to her milady continued her	348.02
do you think that sorrow for madame danglars undeceive yourself again either am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting	436.96
threw and	588.16
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what there that calash filled with roman	159.98
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived	130.34
let us be on our	66.26
it is folly admit but still it is the	407.86
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by	173.52
you would be no longer lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like mushroom in the	259.33
you persist then swear it before the god who hears	338.38
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an	744.40
the soldiers seized dantès who followed	1606.46
and your precautions were successful completely	2712.51
thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced more appalling	502.92
and the consequence said artagnan in great	240.95
ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself should my dear artagnan have been so but nature said	170.36
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of	177.03
and as the man approached artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by	140.03
well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being	123.48
and if he doesn go straight will crush him that	303.31
come take little oath for me on the cross won ask anything more of	362.22
you make me shudder	1491.53
it is in london they must be	63.62
you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau document which she filled up and	186.93
in word an almost poetical fervor	9935.34
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in bride of	449.47
was there too and never shall forget the old man smile at this	290.30
here he said take this pocket	291.54
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port	882.76
you have told me yourself madame that have been drawn into snare perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange have for some time had presentiment that should shortly	206.47
must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be happy and suitable	232.29
ah here is my mother cried the	86.17
de boville manifested signs of extraordinary	4325.34
was as told him resolved to die of	209.87
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said	88.29
do not say regret no will never pronounce that sentence which would not be	417.59
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of fellow	96.43
will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such man as lieutenant général the count of morcerf peer of	315.74
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents	633.66
and cried artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which artagnan on arriving had observed saddled	338.16
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son now remember having had the honor of meeting	278.56
at ten clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little	237.46
contempt my friend how does this misfortune affect you no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father	578.75
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of	458.59
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and slight though meaning smile passed over his	375.83
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of	143.57
nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you	47.89
describe to me your abduction pray	374.39
valentine said morrel death is in itself	432.70
burning fire red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my	681.08
this measure somewhat reassured	13722.55
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony	117.54
omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate morsel from their hands on the stones of the street they departed	237.08
so have little adventure to propose to you when the count is	115.95
before him rose grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent	849.86
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and to	166.36
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill	117.81
and since your return to england have not handled card or dice	998.76
but these francs here they are and more	313.84
he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of	650.22
athos porthos and aramis you are looking for them	113.16
artagnan shrugged his	477.92
who and where is he he is	90.10
and who had lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn have too much	850.06
it appears that our journey was remounting journey then exactly so said artagnan and nodding to planchet he went	324.83
yes yes	231.50
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in	180.55
whether he kept watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody	423.87
there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called	967.87
the pistol fell from his	128.15
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino yes was the laconic	238.73
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with knife	526.73
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their	299.61

there were two palaces and vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his	386.67
you understand me said the	19.07
having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to	167.24
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur	250.80
monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the	214.71
he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its	505.31
he will do wonders	855.90
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost	329.03
breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time very strong light he perceived the fine writing of	283.41
de villefort promises do not know	74.35
foi_ no returned	374.60
but where are you really going to sea viscount you know am	235.18
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great	529.99
then he said aloud you met him dare say in the park hunting perhaps no nearer nearer	871.53
he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse	110.06
sir said albert at first with tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer reproached you with exposing the conduct	665.41
at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of	650.66
signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had	177.15
the comte de la fere is not	28.52
if it be not an indelicate question resumed artagnan have you grown rich oh heaven	840.51
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own	94.24
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his	267.06
but he had gone about two hundred steps artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his	174.09
mazarin uttered cry and became paler than the man who had brought the	95.72
he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put gag in his	196.80
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to	374.17
oh it was touching superstition monsieur and although did not myself believe it would not for the world have destroyed my father	186.61
why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some	196.31
you disturb me oh quite the contrary dear friend swear and as proof of what say permit me to declare am rejoiced to see you safe and	287.83
mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the	147.37
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no	116.20
everything had gone on as usual at the palais	98.07

well swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune yes egad of bethune not been there would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even thinking of	249.06

how is there still time asked the man in the	60.76
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as vague project but today you see it was reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your	427.06
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the	108.92

loved my brother tenderly as told your excellency and resolved not to send the money but to take it to him	122.31
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already	368.49
artagnan saw from the expression of the queen face that she was about to issue some violent	101.32
really my	17.74
come tell me what is the joke monsieur le vicomte knows that never	264.10
did he know my father christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes had told him that long since and did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps	229.96
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he	1760.04
is that what you wish for asked	75.01
at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and	305.54
at this moment the clock	68.37
his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private mission that could be confided only to sure man and so has sent me to saint	234.36
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good	137.19
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his	106.91
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered	354.33
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said will lay wager your honor that you and are thinking of the same	236.64
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops gave you you would now be	350.31
but if am not hungry said the young	34.44
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one	473.28
athos prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no	195.10
in addition to this half hour conversation artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and purity that left no doubt on that	382.37
where do you live	81.33
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de	96.63
and you am lord de winter baron	520.19
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde est leve ce matin je crois qu il gronde contre le	12348.42
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only every one had	240.95
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu creature my	353.92

is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his	121.17
well now tell your story	809.51
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored	102.15

you will no longer have half dead body tied to you as drag to all your	379.17
monte cristo drew morrel step or two behind his brother in	202.92
gently gently said the old man with smile and by your leave will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at time that had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase	123.88

but continued she lord wilmore had family or friends he must have known someone can we not oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps all he was not the man you seek	257.96
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot	251.73
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign confidence and	202.68
were the following lines which can never forget the great wars of romagna had ended cæsar borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all	610.35
florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill and he hastened to the	162.80

bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant	550.20
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of	146.23
noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of man desiring an	343.85

de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had	83.20

morrel who with melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of	982.98
but why this question because while you were talking with him watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard did not lose movement of his	225.25

porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great	121.52
and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet	582.40
and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord	258.34
but artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword	705.39
in fact at the end of few minutes the belfry of	71.74
from the comte de la fere said	12.82
the whole assembly uttered long murmur of	1324.35
oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit	319.72
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow	487.00
repeat it repeat it cried artagnan it will make little	180.40
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be	434.13

our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads	1000.02
my lord said athos do not let us disturb	27.66
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her	419.96
albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate	371.67
ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more your parents have chosen you bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not	467.39

by the way planchet think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly frightfully low	261.98
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man who rather improbable thing had stolen his father letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred might not this young man be sent by his eminence might he not have come for the purpose of laying snare for him this pretended artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in thousand other instances he fixed his eyes upon artagnan even more earnestly than	273.34
be it so said the count	51.58
his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as could judge in the few minutes he remained	159.58

madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that finally abandoned the	181.61
but marrying as am about to do before all paris ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in	189.59
yet through singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to	388.52
policar morrel who served under the government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of	410.05

he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the	396.03

poor fellow poor young man and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you he	245.68
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the	191.46
noirtier turned pale and made sign that he wished to	41.26
his resolution not to sign lasted two days which he offered million for some	754.90
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of	653.50
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was	33.40

not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while third on horseback holding musket in his fist was posted as sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of	314.54
ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this one display of	165.50

at last artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare fourth thrust but the moment when fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and artagnan blade caught between the panels shivered like sword of	686.04
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide	150.17
artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was	657.61

porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so	267.73
as soon as	111.23
and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of large	76.25
did not know when came with such haste to you that was to meet an enemy	131.25
he saw that the duke was searching for means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to	145.84
you see he said to	55.71
he was an italian and therefore	487.06

these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck shower of sparks from the	130.71
he perceived then at glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which artagnan had hitherto	402.95

you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom ve hated for long time	159.75
and you think that to save such villains as you will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes reverend sir said caderousse drawing still	440.34
he found athos and aramis	523.21
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were oh god forbid then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each	133.61
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their	587.29
promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his	456.87
ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry	387.23
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine	377.71
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter give you my word of honor sir said dantès but what is the matter you are ill shall ring for assistance shall call no said villefort rising hastily stay where you	100.88
and yet you spoke of him at	118.85
the musketeer signified by nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and artagnan went out followed by	282.10
the th of	493.13
it is not to me to whom you must address yourself said	113.32
take my advice renounce this	460.82
ah my dear sir you are most welcome was expecting	162.23
asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments pure and an impure why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment understand english then understand what you say that is because we are talking spanish my dear friend said	167.14
think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for	260.81
there now said eugénie while change my costume do you lock the	772.24
what is he doing up there and they called château renaud attention to	233.39
you are insupportable cried the duke shall beat	176.43
arrived at the end of the lane artagnan turned to the	47.11
yes those who have died of	347.82
danglars left where has he gone do not	275.33
whole days have passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time had contrived to carry away square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish dug up was compelled to break through staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to	659.06
thought my body was my own and that might sell	145.17
yes duke yes know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion warn you at some future period to speak of	236.46
half an hour an hour an hour and half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were	333.18
you evidently know	770.42
and then the queen the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be	160.26
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it	192.87
have that honor your	205.98
then today madame oh today am no further than	702.09
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes prince or president or some dowager	1506.98
my dear artagnan said aramis don be too angry with me	97.05
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an	404.57
he was man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by	703.10
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties artagnan would become the preserver of his	611.57
what ails you my dearest father are you ill inquired the young man much	349.59
the queen had just regained her chamber and artagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	136.56
hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music	1533.57
or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become	350.28
meantime artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the	116.19
you monseigneur yes or at least	486.42
then tell me all you know about the	147.13
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of	205.87
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the	548.90
madame said he bear to your majesty letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his	105.04
indeed am replied the young magistrate with smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more	194.79
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle	312.28
what does scandal signify to me what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your	1223.48
what is your errand then with me sir mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace mean to propose meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the	299.26
if on the contrary die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate	299.64
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges or	265.00
no matter said artagnan in his most wheedling	130.95
it is not only valuable diamond but it is an enchanted	281.25
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady	605.73
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	683.26
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	481.25
particularly when there is money in the house eh answered caderousse double locking the	321.67
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural	218.00
you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	198.54
it is nearly eight clock and at nine expect	421.24
this exclamation which corresponded to the count own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with	427.80
hunting for the equipments chapter	1167.94
épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep promise and fulfil	229.68
by the way have received news of	254.76
listen he said today is the th of september is it not	129.98
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and artagnan more than	185.88
gracious heaven exclaimed	389.08
what would you have said monte cristo we are all	54.01
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the	553.31
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and	37.79
chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the	213.71
yes said	52.33
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of man who lifts weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon	742.58
so in twelve times you thrice missed the	1763.92
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last	317.61
de bracieux de pierrefonds added	481.16
inter cœlorum	156246.08
ask him then for the written	292.27
and where are we going asked	103.78
épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary	641.44
franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his	71.80
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen will you permit grandson of henry	1263.43
mean young man whom you patronize monsieur de	161.67
can trust you you are true frenchman am an old soldier of rocroy my	287.71
have induced you to take charming promenade here is delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each	695.07
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous	650.40
swallow every morning spoonful of the mixture prepared for my	673.97
well baron promise you some good exercise said the	340.27
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide	726.55
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man	90.24
give me anything you like it is of little	122.90
john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his	608.73
something better still	5119.57
believe me dear albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling believe me feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way can serve you am	153.13
he must be mad said the	57.98
no one has letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of	276.24
extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped	196.74
yes said felton but silence silence must have time to file through these	383.77
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the	221.34
had it been possible to save you should have considered it another proof of god mercy and would again have endeavored to restore you swear by my father	222.70
do you wish for name should you like to be rich and your own master said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such question take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pont de	282.65
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon	411.36
jeune amélie_ was first at the	444.77
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his	68.65
oh do something for	114.71
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with	65.13
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in	204.14
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to	273.10
oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against minister of	818.31
somebody there received your packet and gave you letter in place of it think yes the grand marshal	371.99
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due	158.67
you do not reply to my question replied the inspector	130.97
they then dressed	578.02
major cavalcanti	2267.97
and how shall be dressed demanded	421.31
anne de bueil murmured the wounded	253.03
for me said artagnan seizing the	54.11
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	627.55
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed set of pearly	538.87
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open door then went forward	349.42
burnt it for fear that even fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your	305.76
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following	204.47
he will inform against	316.91
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same	77.37
then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé	158.40
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful manner to be sure remember it all	318.96
it was however too late albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker	223.42
you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the	552.33
raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing	115.98
we will be with you at that time said the	40.66
indeed on my	94.31
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the	167.87
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive	83.62
de monte cristo	55.67
does he still live inquired the	456.63
some years	673.02
but there was more difficulty in arousing	427.90
no we heard think the sound of her but she remained perfectly	401.28
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you how could know what was the bearer of that true and you are going to portsmouth have no time to	123.85
that all you know of him asked	93.96
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have nice little fricassee	990.44
but repeat to you am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from	96.23
he will come in here	64.89
he would have spoken but his voice failed	273.08
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if fresh thought suggested itself to her	229.75
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch of	415.39
well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve	192.78
well said milady for you will	41.11
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy am to attribute the violence that is done me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in	159.87
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally	321.62
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	114.52
tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest	213.91
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in hollow of the	320.08
no one had more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like	342.87
what he continued can have been following false path can the end which proposed be mistaken end can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not sacrilegious undertaking cannot reconcile myself to this idea it would madden	522.30
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the count heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young man shoulder said was looking for you my	214.40
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried	132.03
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till	138.85
ah dear artagnan see how regularly live and how easy am	537.99
knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then	253.61
artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin ante	116.99
ah indeed said	286.43
gaspard caderousse he had married woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her	121.99
you have only to wait here till release	216.72
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went	449.17
then it seems am to eat alone remarked the	403.42
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres thought should find four axes for one as was to meet four	795.83
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and	279.30
look at my hat and	231.01
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen was afraid you were dangerously	389.90
then you abandon me doctor yes for can follow you no farther and only stop at the foot of the	204.94
it was large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of	245.51
whenever your majesty	288.59
was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have	210.32
athos then made him sign to take up his basket and to walk on	113.78
she learned drawing music	12080.42
another method of assassination said the general shrugging his	312.43
but can continue to visit madame de chevreuse should say you could and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both	207.55
how was it that presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès	271.11
and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the	343.18
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the	121.26
aramis then joined athos and artagnan who were consulting	355.85
the brief space had however been sufficient for man followed by number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost	179.98
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm	124.52
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if do not make it although have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand maintain my original	144.58
artagnan pursued his	324.90
de château	95.71
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king	74.10
de tréville in feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and have hastened to receive your	197.48
alas madame exclaimed artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had just idea of	264.90
countenance nothing that is	405.93
and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the	488.77
good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly	334.11
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such	311.09
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the	3537.57
besides in accepting it she added in voice full of emotion you render me much greater service than you	347.95
the misfortune is great but think you have still good number of falcons sparrow hawks and	687.04
you have my word monsieur and here is my	85.16
what must do to attain such sublimity you are today free as air come and dine with me we shall be small party only yourself my mother	306.96
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	285.99
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his	325.06
let us drink my dear artagnan let us drink while the wine is fresh let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me little of what is going on in the world	130.26
in the rue	263.76
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at	693.52
monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given	114.23
ah said andrea when may we hope for that pleasure on saturday if you will	222.97
everything was in	141.66
and he heaved	1998.28
well at the end of ten days you would have taken centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as	156.00
what are you doing said	32.27
he turned towards porthos and	53.72
the devil murmured he between his	207.18
droll way of showing your	1874.62
what is that to find such wife as my father	136.15
and you artagnan twenty	434.96
morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder	249.00
do you know what has become of athos asked artagnan of planchet as they galloped	83.83
de villefort answered morrel but was of madame de saint	46.78
think should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his	75.21
the servant bowed and	233.97
at four clock artagnan recommenced his	454.47
yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and	1175.43
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on journey which would detain him some	181.48
oh father father murmured she courage the has gone down then said morrel in hoarse	338.13
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of postilion whose only answer was	274.64
come said danglars you appear to me good sort of fellow and hang me should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely	127.67
undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me	225.72
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed	398.96
sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my	156.44
shall either return for them myself or shall send courier directing you to bring them to	318.57
then sleep here my dear	140.61
guessed all followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in parquet box have seen	321.91
will but go and return sire shall be back in ten	127.51
ah valentine assure you you are	156.47
you must set out for	185.08
and kitty who had not let go the hand of artagnan led him up little dark winding staircase and ascending about fifteen steps opened	333.67
danglars be there he has already been invited by my	99.97
have you something to tell me asked	37.26
not very said	301.39
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured	195.24
the young man uttered groan but appeared	395.41
in an hour it will be at the	35.46
you don imagine he would consider little thing like that at any rate said porthos am glad to hear artagnan admit that he is	247.88
you know have made the most of my arms though never forgot my	320.50
noirtier wants said the	317.84
will take him dead that	230.77
the place	5073.28
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over	257.07
good god cried she two thousand livres why that is fortune porthos made most significant grimace	914.15
of what oh that is not my secret must not therefore tell	111.51
ask pardon of your eminence said artagnan but was so fatigued don ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my	144.54
tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making violent effort over himself he said have right to insist on your giving me an	322.51
olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the	147.78
de villefort are both coming to this	225.09
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time think all must be	117.14
morrel didn dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old man being so pleased to think that you who were perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but love him for showing so much interest in	212.36
if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the	187.97
will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an	266.72
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes	642.00
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the	285.11
you are too bad athos one can hide nothing from you answered	321.67
oh that very well young man	98.00
then sudden idea crossed the mind of	373.69
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep	101.25
and did you also discover bitter taste	1259.10
ah miss three they were here last night sir am sure they were here counted	577.54
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings	102.78
that prohibition is not for me said	76.75
and of what did he die asked caderousse in choking	146.07
how said	36.93
am all attention said	149.33
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their	89.46
grimaud he cried remain wish	646.70
well decapitator guardian of the state royalist brutus what is the matter said	714.18
yes my lord at any rate think	225.88
felton in his turn suppliant clasped his	204.29
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly	175.33
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner	46.63
do not deceive	338.49
will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their	365.54
come my brother go with me added artagnan and will see that you are made duke no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with	288.05
the marquis took his arm and they left the	113.89
the house may be suspected but deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur artagnan for can affirm sire if can believe what he says that there does not exist more devoted servant of your majesty or more profound admirer of monsieur the	192.37
yes he has wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of ruined man he has besides son lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his	295.72
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall single word indicating any previous acquaintance between	336.22
it is the first time then that you ever went to that house	121.07
say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his	321.91
when you return will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by	216.20
the idea of asking how hear the news he	287.87
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo eye was on	306.08
to the boat to the boat but porthos do not see	70.96
have an engagement with pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till	200.37

athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way	1414.24
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his	1391.23
even athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then	171.34
this time it the hour and from this moment milady waited with	216.94
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person	148.54

artagnan with sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of musketeer at the expense of ten years of his	176.96
why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin	164.83
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he	121.47

the name of artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years the events which we have related in preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be model of courage address and	199.99
albert listened with the most profound	183.31

albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the	117.22
on the evening of the day the arrest of poor bonacieux as athos had just left artagnan to report	110.55
ah how strange it seems that such young and beautiful woman should be so	277.82

and artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole	176.35
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it mysterious story gilded by an immense	401.73
it is not at all amusing here there is not single woman	180.59
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal	196.96
artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my	145.77

the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought	1028.19
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said	151.98
penelon turned to his companions and exchanged few words with	113.08
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague	299.08
it was melancholy sight that of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as	563.92

he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth he cared little for that mene tekel upharsin_ which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced	417.34

when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried carbine presented arms the manner of sentinel and cried who comes there in	432.32
perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur	155.60
athos saw the movement he made step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be	143.39
that voice also was known to	401.35

and on what have you written all this on two of my	324.75
artagnan who as gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos maxim but he did his best to keep up with his	224.25
yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass here to his health his health hurrah but the means the means said	557.34
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter gave	143.14
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the	130.86

artagnan and the englishman chapter	465.12
villefort for declaration to be available should be made before the competent	695.80
these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least right to exact from him good reason for so	313.32
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss	200.50
you had only read line or two said artagnan read the letter again from the	201.53
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this	43.83
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the	251.87
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but revelation on her part would bring about revelation on the part of	145.19

one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had	127.35
he was nineteen when he entered the château if he was thirty three when he	140.91
morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the count guidance followed course of archæology mineralogy and natural	313.77
he drew out his watch and exclaimed nearly nine clock why shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight good night my	417.36
this winding sheet was nothing more than beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought fortnight	315.12
beware of what you are about gentlemen said clear voice which seemed accustomed to	159.71
meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is letter from her	333.41
artagnan bowed to the duke and was	125.47
château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had	152.69
and who told you this fine story the king	213.48
yes my lord like yourself said the queen	138.02
suffer from emotion said monte	100.11
artagnan pretended	19036.45
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict	315.27
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the	129.39
what is it asked	43.30
this evening then at quarter to nine at the	149.79

and he placed the bonds in his pocket	121.15
the resumed the jesuit	1443.22
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he	293.71
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable distinction as the marshal baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy line of battle at	300.14
and swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with	543.89
and what shall say to the people that they must have patience said anne as	99.86
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion elbow directed his attention by his	969.28
it is great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas marshal staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly have left the service	320.72
artagnan and athos refused	444.05
in the meantime artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la	79.55
why you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	631.93
artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet	106.21
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep	196.48
you have sister asked the	57.95
madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank	714.67
danglars no longer had	441.32
the first time he saw artagnan you have come off well said he to him there is your jussac thrust paid	154.95
think that man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other	186.48
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it	178.61
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into	155.85
good bye till we meet	1157.78
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the	285.22
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six	310.18
have you not slept said the	97.51
come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival leave the carriage entirely at your	203.10
avrigny with slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for will come no	261.02
am manifestly protected in most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white	388.00
château renaud and morcerf exchanged third look of still increasing	1474.43
artagnan saw that the moment was	69.50
what is the matter maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your	143.64
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this	141.62
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing	109.81
then must make journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my	212.20
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine	121.53
valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her second	430.97
confess began to be very uneasy on your	88.72
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this	90.12
fernand cried mercédès believed you were good hearted and was mistaken fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes will not deny it do await and do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate will tell you that he died loving me and me	213.10
am watching said	204.22
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no	707.43
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont	160.94
ah said monte cristo did not expect that the affair would be so promptly	87.11
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed artagnan aside with his	182.73
it is only the dead who do not	51.20
de la trémouille in whose service he had relative artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out exchanging some words with artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the	158.91
took the mule and the horse for what he owed us he assured me that they were two noble	224.19
oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then he did not credit it at the period which knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does	206.16
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the	48.05
from seven clock in the morning crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the	170.86
four men surrounded him besides the	690.20
the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten	92.76
yes said the duke smiling and even believe that know that other person it is my lord have not named her interrupted the young man	105.17
the others	988.80
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever	4189.07
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this	548.21
can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	78.51
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no	107.23
monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket	147.33
what next my friend you impose painful task on	942.88
the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now	72.56
this time artagnan was not	164.00
they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and would lay down my life for	250.04
de saint méran madame de saint	11.11
or the mysterious benefactress said	429.82
did you come here sir to see the telegraph he	56.76
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your	175.69
once knew bragelonne is he still alive no sir he is dead and believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which take my	384.01
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came	214.78
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext	1596.22
eighteen leagues is enough for the first	480.03
porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to artagnan to the great astonishment of the young	46.94
what you scoundrel have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven no monsieur we keep him in the cellar you do not know what he is about in the	130.69
man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new comers contemplated	203.78
eugénie became	1954.17
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the	268.49
their number was	339.00
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow single soul of us to set foot in the	198.16
what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite	321.52
madame said the young man bowing can refuse nothing asked of me	172.48
my prisoner he	228.58
come and will explain to	56.42
de winter shook him by the	82.65
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that question can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as did not know when might again come to paris	134.18
it was estimated at fifty thousand	260.49
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to holy indignation you pious man you who are called just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and will	197.00
six clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven clock dinner was ready and served	180.08
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be	130.88
and without losing minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within wedding	842.27
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for	196.45
well then said artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	107.22
by musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the	122.52
they heard the horsemen pass under the	295.02
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was sou left in her	365.51
certainly might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my	867.39
won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then lost	426.72
the procurator wife shed	5106.25
where is the count friend lead me to	71.69
would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did not possess moral distrust of my best friends and sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule should as the actors say be playing part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of	417.43
all hands to the pumps shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came	388.57
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father will	126.24
listen to	16.67
you have doubtless heard the adventures	122.07
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her	564.01
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved was set at	214.87
returned last night and here	404.73
your mother your sister who will support them shudder ran through the young man	368.83

that is	29.73
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him the reduction of paris to assume for his arms golden lion passant upon gules with the motto et	558.99
artagnan alone was calm at least in	198.83
as captain of the	132.69
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the	263.25
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his	82.37
what was most clear in the matter was that artagnan loved milady like madman and that she did not love him at	134.44
my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their	207.58
follow us at distance of twenty paces as far as the louvre and if anyone watches us slay him artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm allowed the duke and	329.68
but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to	40.32
he placed himself at the table and wrote little note which he sealed with ring and gave the billet to	178.60
artagnan my	50.73
how many men does your eminence wish to escort you you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord	243.14
had such uniform as your eminence possesses protest should be mightily content and would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night adventure don suppose my dress would have been very safe	530.12
for pity sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pity sake do not call assistance save me will not harm	477.05
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal	895.67
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your	277.37
was where artagnan	1763.87
then she knew that he was one of the friends	28.48
artagnan artagnan cried athos my son entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let man die without extending hand to save	315.06
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until more favorable	608.07
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal	672.61
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left	162.76
well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemy	103.24
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask single	140.55
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it	139.12
alas sir replied the queen have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making	215.65
progress of cavalcanti the younger	1558.06
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found resting place in his	628.47
grimaud is well bred	1839.52
no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month am tormented by	145.50
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated	1487.06
from la rochelle and you from	358.31

really pray tell me all about it for it must be	121.56
almost an impossibility replied the	436.37
well said	51.73
this was man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen coachmen on cold night and in the summer he made point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the	308.24
milady looked around her as if in search of	91.23

lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy	747.83
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction	301.02
that is my condemnation thought artagnan he will spare me the of the bastille or the tediousness of	252.02

dantès uttered cry of joy and surprise never had first attempt been crowned with more perfect	644.79
oh mon dieu he said raising his fine eyes to artagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me he left four days ago said	305.45
and with this conclusion way peculiar to himself he rose and left the	208.19

as to that said athos beg you to believe that care very little about	144.58
thank you sir answered the young man much	51.93
it is best to constitute myself at once prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with artagnan who most probably will	194.35
ten minutes she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to	450.11
the guide took them thinking them merely few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true	575.95
the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is	294.23

dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if have offended you and forget the words spoke if they have unwittingly caused you	560.27
ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet	269.28
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond	128.45
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and	641.38
felt his blood gush over my face but was intoxicated was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning	689.09
all three then cried all	622.41
armed to the teeth replied	180.04
well when was clerk morcerf was mere	4959.28
in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her	371.20
mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lover	493.25
artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not	101.86
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the	91.75
hardly had artagnan seen through crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of	258.72
ah yes see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to confessor and you know have taken	102.06
know that it is terrible said artagnan but when reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that	331.17
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the	170.63
there nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it	341.74
casa pastrini said the to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly	270.28
father and daughter volume five	2731.81
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty	178.29
ah said he you have remarked must have been blind not to have	78.73
and madame replied athos am looking with	174.85
noirtier look continued to	838.87
there is servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the	404.65
the two friends looked at each	22.74
albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished	697.23
noirtier face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man	461.11
do you wish for notary asked	97.33
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined	474.74
steel is for	320.17
confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such	166.39
it contained half line in hand perfectly british and with conciseness as perfectly spartan you be	1928.03
de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort evêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for moment abandoned	543.87
his brain was on fire and life and energy	579.68
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	171.34
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	2026.33
he entered by the faubourg	196.32
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	405.43
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind curtain and turned	269.11
well within week am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions promise you will produce ten or	587.92
la chesnaye said the	108.10
for his father death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of	150.59
suddenly yes like clap of	1165.79
why if my information prove correct sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been	703.64
as to the horse ride him little every day and that will accustom you to his	451.33
indeed said	34.86
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the	139.56
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of	854.22
come said artagnan who thought that it was now convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is no sir replied	235.46
artagnan was passing along lane on the spot where the rue assas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of	337.77
in three seconds artagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos and one for aramis at the third hit the gentleman fell like	525.62
maximilian understood	321.19
then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love then mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin your ruin accelerate your ruin what do you mean do not understand	262.57
what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to	408.65
gardener grimaud	10424.86
well will tell you	134.72
dantès was on his	32.44
doctor do you hear them call for help yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentine	183.64
you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole	621.64
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of artagnan and porthos piece of advice which was received with contemptuous	328.05
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they	638.44
there said la carconte as she placed bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you	225.48
you told him it was for me yes and he said he would do his best to please your	87.65
mother and son	629.66

mazarin contemplated these proceedings with thoughtful	4452.44
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession you gave de wardes meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not no no it is not true said milady in tone of voice so firm and with countenance so unchanged that if artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have	217.97
come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want speak quickly	273.41
but all asked porthos who is milady charming woman said athos sipping glass of sparkling	481.69
poverty pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make man beg steal loaf of bread at baker door but not cause him to open secretaire in house supposed to be	1770.21
this is all can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself	84.31
artagnan went straight to the stables day was just	387.52
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days having received the	215.48
see this gentleman out said the count to	151.75
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it	572.07
he inquired what was the will of his persevering	543.90
generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him great service great service what was that why it seems that crushed for him parliament	429.96
noirtier asks for notary suppose he really wishes for notary therefore shall go at once and fetch	611.29
that is very few said the	154.67
meanwhile let us sit down and	181.49
as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos have the scene again before me as if now were	105.55
the worthy shipowner knew from penelon recital of the captain brave conduct during the storm and tried to console	685.93
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their	458.19
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his	284.73
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his	243.91
you think then as do that she deceives me said the	125.78
will you name him oh you know him well my lord it is count de	103.24
it was mordaunt with the order in his	67.49
gentlemen said the duke will thank you later now we have not moment to	89.07
planchet said artagnan commit the corpse of this poor devil to your	170.69
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous	752.50
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of	518.91
as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the sweetmeats as they do not show the	121.85
there is however proverb current in france relating to water which is	1131.48
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent	162.54
it was the plan of alexander	339.96
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so	258.10
stop moment cried artagnan pray how many men have you on board captain don understand was the	348.71
alas said milady know it is	33.82
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into loud	1946.83
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura is it not inquired madame de	290.47
therefore when cough stretch out your	2897.11
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of	247.34
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed	630.68
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his	191.32
to delay it single day would be in my eyes now to commit fresh	447.66
years of suffering in my opinion count double and have suffered for twenty	287.72
his majesty has so good heart that he cannot understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason england is torn in twain by spirit of disturbance which greatly fear blood alone can	698.63
without seeing mademoiselle valentine	896.82
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the	400.84
well my poor friend replied beauchamp expected	95.10
but mazarin is low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an	699.66
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the	440.53
nothing more	611.10
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his	406.42
peppino was handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would	187.52
still as five clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his	206.48
alas murmured he with intense suffering might then have been happy	432.75
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his	181.53
at this word athos and aramis jumped	125.79
the antechamber	458.89
could not contain himself and he made step toward the queen apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless	303.61
bazin beadle at notre dame he must know where his master is without doubt he	331.56
and charmed it	1821.56
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in day never in an hour never in ten	343.49
this lad for he was scarcely man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefort severe look and stern	584.64
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was	90.86
my dear count said albert will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be	199.63
albert understood the allusion in moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of challenge held him	247.81
and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this	317.80
at bourges yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles	467.58
artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such paradise then he shook his head saying if were porthos and artagnan came to make me such proposition as am going to make to him know what should say to	217.33
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued artagnan with his frank	94.82
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real	224.15
the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert prison and franz and the count followed	128.48
and that is the only reply you make alas	227.97
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already	175.43
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at	1116.16
let me conduct your business and my	156.94
ah ah said	204.99
bonacieux was going that was to follow	69.62
they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were	478.43
hem said artagnan there is some truth in what you	40.05
the most important thing was not to kill him only for had an opportunity of doing so hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being	141.82
noirtier eye bade her	2439.26
well at few minutes to seven at few minutes to seven cried la ramee cold sweat upon his	266.55
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count am quite sorry not to have met you	327.63
their connection could not last long without ruining	1080.24
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not good man man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off joke but your excellency has not read	296.88
artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of	150.99
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	141.97
will your majesty deign to excuse me speak sir speak boldly replied	336.88
beauchamp looked at albert with benevolent	213.52
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for	498.94
thought had been deceived had mistaken the	221.24
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other	278.26
oh feel easy replied	348.52
de chevreuse who though exiled to tours and believed to be in that city had come to paris remained there five days and outwitted the police the king flew into furious	357.81
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking single word until he had	159.58
and he struck his breast with his emaciated	397.84
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your	478.57
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if had employed it for another purpose should bring on me disgraceful	551.90
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of	286.63
this night have had fearful	1540.02
those were good old days never fear these people owe us no	1219.02
if could die he said should go where he goes and should assuredly find him	264.13
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your	430.40
now said the king give the word and let us	65.97
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one	240.43
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in week shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and	192.03
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen	58.76
mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain	250.86
and madame de villefort and sometimes confess have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our	81.27
the first named malefactor will be the second	847.63
is that monte cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in melancholy	219.77
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it was looking for frightful discharge of musketry which would crush	346.20
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god	380.51
what is that inquired the	42.26
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very	47.84
it was there lodging was prepared for	197.21
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of little pocket book with golden clasps remnant of his old fancies or perhaps tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book note of	333.14
than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by	702.67
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to	129.86
your majesty mind may be quite at ease replied the officer have my answer	260.73
behind the head of the bed and concealed by stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was hollow space and in this space ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in	369.98
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of contract should occupy so long time without unexpected	423.68
that is slight difficulty said porthos and good push with the shoulders for god sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they	426.35
bring them	175.54
well well	34.63
that difficult replied	413.87
come am growing an old woman said the duchess	377.78
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods	864.52
what rival foi what rival why your	10370.37
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and	480.48
that was no reason for staking my diamond replied artagnan closing his hand with nervous	277.87
should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with	91.04
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the	281.46
in saying these words artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and	148.96
these words of felton passed like ice through her	640.53
monte cristo had seen	53.78
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by	315.50
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	318.59
my dear athos wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for	478.58
he answered therefore think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when was in his	170.47
see said she if everything does not second us here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	209.07
de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday	254.95
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my	223.82
did she afterward return yes but only to take little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again	417.31

asked you if you knew him extremely	179.87
oubliettes are employed as means of kingly vengeance and low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to	397.23
have replied artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	78.27
well here am proving at once that am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that	301.13
do you possess that right over bertuccio	572.80

he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as	163.49
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down narrow staircase	264.76
artagnan rattled the gold in his	491.70
now then said artagnan this is something like this is means of	96.34
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and	286.27
this evening said the	43.62
de monte cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to	196.47
but hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful	129.57
what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the	131.49

this is what propose to do said	65.56
the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed de combat_ in cabaret squabble you don do your work by	623.49
when you spoke to me of experiencing vague and indefinite sense of coming danger placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged	333.09
the result was that even if the king troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the	233.30

so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an	606.26
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	864.46
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte	81.26
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard	208.52
then artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre respectable looking house and this artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy	201.76
will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to	190.23
artagnan ran	830.88
so now breathe again am happy don be in haste to celebrate victory porthos interposed artagnan never have we incurred greater danger than we are now	884.45
suspicion instantly seized	758.76
he could not see it but he its	140.66
de monte cristo purchased house at auteuil certainly for he told	224.09
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards	296.94

ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris why so on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so	375.43
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard	585.08
used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were	333.56
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery	211.04
as for me answered porthos wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into barony with promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates	421.77
thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until	97.16
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under	139.60
aramis must have worn himself to shadow of his former self by constant	665.44

and he did not see raoul asked	46.26
there was	236.37
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his	30.80
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their	374.58
benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have since that day either seen or heard anything concerning	859.80
they did not dare to ask him how he had	61.46
and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was	386.65
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite	113.41
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their	342.18
can work then said the	149.45
almost immediately bertuccio entered the	397.79
he stopped at short distance from the house and	140.42
no for that very resemblance affrights me should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of	712.11
artagnan received him as he would have done friend of twenty years	129.21
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize	123.79
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive	369.37
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by artagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars	330.77
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing strong horse between his knees and crying out in loud voice am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante	239.40
alas in these days the throne is too dangerous place for me to wish him to retain	148.26
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to	119.96
am always curious to see the downfall of your honor enemies and he was not among the least of	126.47
well said the queen it has been	44.22
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for few hours of sound sleep artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an	261.41
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into	118.36
now it is that regret	180.69
they disobeyed	31297.98
my lord have you any commands asked	380.99
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding	463.65
count will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire someone you know am at your service and still more my	123.73
oh said caderousse groaning with	506.12
athos glanced at	240.61

on my part will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be	81.49
the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent	495.73
women are very indiscreet my	443.09
yes my	18.23
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still	408.60

bonacieux and convent was not	1529.53
and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy six	536.03
and what have done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried	96.99
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against seat placed near one of the open	484.35
quà_ said one of the men descending little path leading out of the appian	278.07
artagnan little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and	1087.46
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your	664.15
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and	186.16
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their	2779.22

the pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughter	344.53
there was then amongst that crowd moment hesitation which looked like	1004.15
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he	197.88
the count frowned apparently in gloomy	1962.50
as was his custom artagnan presented himself at milady at about nine	152.35
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior	235.17
and thus they parted the best possible friends	635.22
well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is very likely	66.58
good mother cannot depart without her	600.27
decidedly athos you were born to be general and the cardinal who fancies himself great soldier is nothing beside	217.09
have brought my	1165.59
in the midst of her despair new affliction overtook	453.03
and what do you know of him nothing my lord except that he is tormented with	95.77
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the	261.10
but what makes you sigh my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you am not	97.07
yes said	96.29
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the	215.61

signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of louis per	269.74
that will do for	80.61
now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villefort astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange	324.44
in that case you will not get beyond	361.23
marie michon oh what do not owe you aramis said	129.40
stop sir look yonder he whispered don you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows fancy hear horses	1212.13
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel bernouin shut the door and went	348.40

he fancied himself burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for month and he set his mind actively to	617.11
but what do see in the water something struggling oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun horse rider they are sinking cried olivain in his	497.43
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself	68.97
yes yes my boy so we will so we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy shall you never leave me again come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen	138.33
every one likes his own uniform best my	1065.57
he consequently kept it as piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded	178.25

planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the	126.75
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with	217.08

the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to	324.20

an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at quarter of mile to the left dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly great light appeared on the strand land might resemble cloud but the fire was not	391.12

you hear sir said artagnan turning to	71.46
had provided myself with dark	1762.38
but does he not approach the walls while playing your eminence doesn know those walls they are sixty feet high and doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping	505.46
and what sort of revenge would you take would triumph over her and supplant my	520.90

the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met similar	204.24

franz hastened to inquire the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four clock to fetch him from the rospoli	123.35
pray what does that mean it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of	355.23

mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering cry of	461.69
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the	453.22

we consider it useless to draw physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to	348.10

it is true he had been playing the day	61.78
it was that paper you read this morning read it again dantès and then will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected	524.40

although artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal	402.70
procureur you must go farther	226.98
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite	213.95

fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart blood but these tears flowed for	414.64

the two things agree marvelously	2883.99
artagnan bowed and went	44.21

anne of austria looked with sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of certain	192.05
he repeated his	494.75
it was then that artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left	124.78

there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new	221.71
just now artagnan continued you were disguised mean to say attired as murderer and now and now look very much like man who is going to be	236.73
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow	1034.83

the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to	465.95

recommend you therefore to keep the strictest	431.49
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies	278.13
and who is the person whom you suspect man who has pursued her long	143.49
nonsense said artagnan you would do as much	94.94

seventy six years that fine age replied	354.69
ah my friend what horrible scene why did we not destroy the child with the mother what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves is this young man an assassin by profession murderer in cold blood he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is	328.40

our clothes have cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first	926.97
fortunately he is cunning fellow that friend	292.22
on the contrary shall feel much	187.32
and do you like him why he pleases me in spite of franz épinay who tries to convince me that he is being returned from the other	170.98

beauchamp is worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and sincere friend love him	329.89

thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say	475.86

oh no replied caderousse that can answer for you did	50.61
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	72.56

yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say see nothing laughable in	207.53
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted	285.19
as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and rochefort	194.66
and what do you suppose is the count age inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this	446.30
when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced	217.38
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more	203.63
during the daytime valentine perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence	991.86

bonacieux was repeating word for word sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was	158.69
during the first act the countess	113.73

he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were	73.99
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with musket or partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute compact group vociferous and full of	949.77

the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my	105.96
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable yes replied	219.04
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and artagnan followed by lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make	225.41
take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles artagnan only required one reason to be	145.42
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind cloud they saw at turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go	318.72

bonacieux we must have them back	171.77

and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned	146.86

monte cristo made sign to him to be	23.33

franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted	188.51
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched spring in panel made to look like picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and	500.75
between the past and the present was an ineffable	279.48
my arm and my life belong to you like my	162.02
do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and	2156.73

rely on	81.46
mazarin hesitated for one instant but artagnan was	218.08
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise	154.11
as you please my dear sir said the jeweller had however as you see brought you the money in bright	165.57
my lord said the guard have simply mentioned the prophecy heard from man named coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the duke of beaufort will escape before	662.69

madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on statue yielding light without	463.80

three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than walk the third to let the enemy fire	417.40

can he give me any particulars important ones he was in india with	685.42
yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm you are astonished see for since this little affair began have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease	505.05
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his	145.29
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that young man of the viscount age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for	279.77
then you have seen him certainly	69.31
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the	219.49
what do you see	128.74
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone fresh fit of despair seized	231.25
what do you think of that albert at two and twenty to be thus famous yes and at his age alexander cæsar and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind	199.98
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued	880.83
de villefort asked monte	17.70
the postscript is	3415.91
who is it they all asked together in low	133.92
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me	1548.88
athos rose walked toward his friend with slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be man women weep for the dead men avenge them oh yes cried artagnan yes if it be to avenge her am ready to follow	256.96
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you threaten to speak and will condemn you to	958.49
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given particular turn to artagnan deliberations this was the name of madame de	378.81
and fernand fernand why much the same	754.93
this would have been favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract	364.85
the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize	632.60
they denounced edmond as bonapartist	4834.98
porthos kill every one who stands in your	482.43
it must be	22.46
the blow was	1526.85
de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak	112.92
speak monsieur speak at once said mazarin what is the matter the matter is my lord that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the chateau of	75.37
the superior met her milady showed her the cardinal	685.11
aramis assumed that perilous	5713.13
this reply reassured the	1997.13
why lived almost on the same floor with the poor old	128.04
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this	64.20
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to	183.77
and then said monte cristo this is not	29.72
then seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door him with the utmost	357.63
it is long time since we have had skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal monsieur de tréville must think us	115.64
well what have you to say you have seen your dream	128.68
and yet if she were man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body the first moments of her captivity were terrible few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to	559.18
have twenty visits to make and as many letters to	367.29
at this moment la ramee the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the	101.59
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or	784.17
yes understand said valentine it is because you love	65.78
had one sir and thank god such as could wish cried artagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from	328.41
when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and	251.17
well my friend there is not moment to lose we must let the king know	98.31
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had	111.34
at this moment grimaud appeared at the	28.32
probabilities are	5148.79
suppose we warn the	625.88
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less	917.73
the skiff	26791.93
taste of this it is spanish wine which our friend athos thought much	287.37
at this moment the young man returned danglars	58.14
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is	1066.04
bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of	472.55
what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had just so returned franz you have guessed	137.67
the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès	1156.21
he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this	419.38
come count you do not do that young man	125.39
let us go and have game at tennis la	189.19
franz was deeply	1103.29
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your	639.32
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us	259.62
ah ah said lord de winter having played comedy having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy the prisoner made no	543.67

noirtier repeated the abbé noirtier knew person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria noirtier who had been girondin during the revolution what was your deputy called de villefort the abbé burst into fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter	256.20
have nothing to say that cannot be said before	75.22

you will excuse me will you not priest can understand father	325.78
yes know that there is secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand	134.53
go then animal said the duke but remember only allow you half an	145.25
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct what madcap was and what stupid fellow am that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which must run head foremost like	538.99
none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his	182.48
laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst artagnan glided behind the	357.55
yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping packet of bank notes into the young man	127.55
he remained listening and	885.10
say it my	77.23
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our	360.28
danglars is money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight	351.49
coquenard understood	260.71
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old	84.40
it was human storm made up of thunder of cries and hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and	1896.22
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his	210.44
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new	349.43
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of	220.12
my dear albert replied franz am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain most erroneous notion concerning italian	423.02
but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before give you an	204.92
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with force which he fancied would prove	345.06
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two	234.09
have they not obeyed me it is done as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your	196.23
those in whom the king has confided lord leven	1499.27
the count	84.15
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her	290.55
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with	153.69
now what you told me this morning of your heart may believe well count replied morrel gayly will not dispute	215.69
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness oh they are simple enough replied the	188.32
my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the	120.21
in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an	256.28
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio	262.66
monte cristo drew out his	60.67
the wretches were	4373.63
with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali repeated his affirmative	1366.28
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged	253.91
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past	458.95
the patron shook his	282.09
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if am not dead shall have seen you again madame even if have to overturn the	309.93
the monk eyes	6545.21
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were	129.37
felt pain wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice fell lifeless and fancied myself	1084.97
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did more distressed countenance give the lie to more amiable	600.44
the countess made no	289.42
the young man eyes kindled in secret but he restrained	238.79
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when	598.49
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit	171.95
why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost	267.06
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if had witnessed	131.88
the count returned to young	225.91
oh command and will	844.97
besides he said treasure is not thing we need hurry	744.17
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the	393.07
you knew the poor lad then continued	311.70
the devil take this gout cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at	529.58
he called for artagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him artagnan not being on	157.18
have no doubt of it said	30.81
don remember	525.73
demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and will furnish the house with all necessary	171.13
it was the way in which he	35.91
when look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same	202.56
then cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead	272.76
well said	20.80
noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful	5937.83
they advanced towards boat which custom house officer held by chain near the	1731.84
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair	109.65
but the glass cutter was prudent man who had provided for all	478.78
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the	106.21
indeed said monte cristo with slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in similar way he must appeal to	281.36
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not	373.41
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame	505.65
but artagnan remained	2597.64
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and brave captain of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the	217.29
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn new traveler stopped on the threshold of the	185.75
in the first place have as precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable	385.62

well what then la ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch	235.66
the devil my dear aramis said artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers	176.08
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any	246.86
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times	948.10
oh it nothing nothing cried	198.05

why replied dantès see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by	1263.78
he wished to call out to him but could not utter	84.12
and so my dear count said artagnan his eminence didn actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and who have insisted and even in manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see	343.74
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his	178.74
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer	102.93
grimaud followed	463.94
we are to meet our friends at the hotel at	108.03
why so your eminence might be	132.84

well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of	265.51
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of minister more powerful than the king	169.60
and this explains how artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la	225.51
he beat retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him	757.26
well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and hundred charges to	566.29
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you truly she might have thought of you at	247.15

no said villefort burying his face in his hands no hundred times no then you did not bury the poor child there sir why did you deceive me where did you place it tell me where there but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon	224.45

but you will remain you are not afraid said artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his	130.94
this was too much for the procurator wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and	180.56
and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as	272.06
but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well think may venture to ask you this	195.70

artagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	127.25

on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friend assurance turned back with him toward the	308.50

each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of	991.80
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of	642.50

well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him	223.55
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his brow yet gave you two hundred francs when left three months	406.24
well the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the	121.01

when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of	97.23

do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy	153.35
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of	913.34
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his	482.77
then it will be	103.50
only replied tréville it is sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue cannot exempt man from infamy and	580.28
and this all knew so well that it was double victory for the court victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her	267.62
she then turned towards the	122.72

how so cried morrel when left her dying monte cristo pressed his hands to his	127.20
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the	184.87
why is she not come asked the prince in low voice addressing his	74.71
what is the use of boring one self with so many things besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as	431.78
artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed	170.71
and both again left the	229.41
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did you were too young to know about such	142.02
the valet de chambre	248.19
man wrapped in cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and	104.87
do not speak for him but for	51.64
that emetic villefort see if it is	732.89
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our money sum at which most assuredly should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with laugh that no prophet is honored in his own	486.48
have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see have some high connections and were to cultivate them little we might meet in the same drawing	328.66
athos merely glanced at	427.00

aramis shook his	71.13
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like bed of	342.62
under what circumstances did we meet he asked	314.07
on the eve of	90.98

artagnan in particular had perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	641.37
alas poor albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their	382.49
oh thanks sir thanks cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have noble	106.69

as they believe that go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow	109.27
did you tell him your whole story	135.03
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as	962.60
always said that this cadet from gascony was well of wisdom murmured athos and the travelers continued their	632.08

the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to	542.51
go in whatever guise you choose for my part shall go	738.57
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself	197.64
is it more serious than going	120.08
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre	292.75

so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else	192.57
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as desert at	464.55
am all attention said the	102.95
ah my dear replied artagnan upon that very horse came to	88.76

carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized	156.62
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly	738.58
de villefort was not at	54.62
de tréville judged that he had not to deal with fool and changing the conversation came straight to the	128.11
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his	133.04

he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders had received did not come from him and that if had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me	139.60

in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep	353.86
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry	140.45
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million	290.64
de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving artagnan response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country double remembrance which makes man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making sign to artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry	216.67
follow him said	22.20
you see do not conceal	174.49
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on chair saying my god thank thee that he knows me	225.31
mind your own business wife replied caderousse	882.76
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say tolerable supper and pretty comfortable	254.17

you seem worthy young man will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this	200.60
then turning to faria inquired if you are well fed said	194.29
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable	333.81
you ll excuse me	329.54
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the	84.38

the queen was ignorant where the mercer young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure	234.92
one said the grave diggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like wounded bird falling falling with rapidity that made his blood	584.92
yes that first and other things	850.12
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be butchery but fight and he resumed his usual good	183.50

what man is that what man is that cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if	349.77
artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the	277.09
have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power have done	131.02

madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the gave her few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to	413.01
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed	615.98

listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal	398.82
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his	487.48
uncertainty is still	385.11
the cardinal referred to that man whom artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor	177.73
the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely	439.93
ah exclaimed avrigny in voice in which the horror of judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of student making	418.90
thank you cried he throwing himself on his	50.00
this intelligence restored every one save athos to	2062.62
that think is as much as shall	139.88
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what am to do	167.00
believe these fellows have managed their	1063.10

passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul way of riding and observed take care raoul have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is great defect in	238.12
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like	206.68
the duke went from one surprise to	282.88
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing	38.77

as artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and servant went to	439.32
what shall we do and when and how proceed it is now eleven answered	365.43
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through glass of	801.73

they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear	281.90
evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of mother she watched for his	427.71
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow flash kindled in his eyes and bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into	284.66

mon dieu said the woman crossing	490.54
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been	513.87
and now think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was	346.58
but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps	252.30
mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked	294.01
what to ask me if want	242.43
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven clock haydée will soon be	307.97
at once	1301.94
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than simple warning to be more	588.56
parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway	424.57
it was now third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the	201.89
did not ask for	40.97
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized pair of pincers he perceived in corner and forced the	509.61
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use would make of it oh hear me to the end that knife give it to me for minute only for mercy for pity sake will embrace your knees you shall shut the door that you may be certain contemplate no injury to you my god to you the only just good and compassionate being have met with to you my preserver perhaps one minute that knife one minute single minute and will restore it to you through the grating of the	315.84

the breakfast	1176.49
don know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my	202.16
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering	206.58
cried artagnan not in the	66.77
and he who says in projection means already decided said	823.28
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten	188.08
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise	451.27
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the	374.73
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less	228.77
at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were	239.97
the chancellor entered half smiling half	2687.30
nonsense say	785.37
the notary looked at the count with	70.03
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been	356.02
well then you shall have it the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her	113.05
go will	773.23
in twenty four hours artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of	266.12

the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on	373.86

andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable	452.79
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at	263.52
believe me to seek quarrel with man is bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that	295.61
but the three millions the three millions are probably on the	107.63

so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call	297.50

the comte de rochefort why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august	256.93
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse	600.38
oh no no cried milady no sir do not call him conjure	131.01
then they follow you asked monte	84.56
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he	346.64
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak	135.29
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we	146.28
wish such scene to be	263.91
danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like ruin where three or four men went and came like	161.84

devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till knew them nearly by heart so that since have been in prison very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before	367.70
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and made you sign in order that you might hold yourself in	184.87
oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give	131.59
are not you the person who brought me letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf your excellency lodges at pastrini hotel	316.74
so once more good	1243.91
in game of tennis asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke	419.18
undoubtedly the call came from faria	1452.91
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the	792.11
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which have always	184.36
we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his	188.40
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint	347.53
we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than	604.29
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with little	243.84
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of	663.64
he is the cause of all this misery am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to	125.86
is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his	76.85
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed	661.01
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his	164.76
pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb	140.67
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was very knightly	669.86
man the discussion is going to begin again said	222.53
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between	192.91
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate	498.99
if they are penitent said athos let them follow	107.20
on his side however great franz desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning	269.12
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be woman of any consideration they lock her up for	1481.09
the victim resisted as much as woman could resist four	542.32
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere he was brave and an honest	189.74
oh said oliver with slight curl of his lip forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been	386.06
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you frank and honorable	414.05
everything shall be done as you say	69.76
was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my	352.59
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the	131.37
why said château	41.17
so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first	152.04
the remembrance of milady recurred to	184.85
which your majesty will think no longer doubt my zeal in your	173.42
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her	304.58
yes know that said buckingham he has	149.15
he is afraid have come to borrow money thought	327.84
how is it concealed behind my	294.65
she is foreigner	2735.53
noirtier had once made will against you against your family in favor of the poor in	262.20
then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the	111.24
he bowed with great friendship to the	136.45
what did your father tell	50.93
the interior of the musketeers chapter	223.43
but hush here comes	8441.94
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said	346.94
bonacieux called long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer house had bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du	392.94
let us go on to another of his	177.98
in the vehicle was young woman and child of about seven or eight clasped in each other	320.98
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them	1228.66
well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at	71.96
were her fears realized was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment she had only one day	370.34
oh very shortly madame said he but do not precisely recollect the date of the	224.21
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur artagnan belongs to the service monsieur artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he	148.05
then cried villefort was it you who	276.36
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than	464.53
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and	185.22
jackson replied	495.09
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of	291.78
monte cristo observed it particularly and by look asked the banker for an	241.44
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such step uttered cries of	334.37
had such delightful	6522.06
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir it is rich study for you who as learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this	374.36
pardon me monsieur said artagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put	49.24
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such silence and ceased to address themselves to	264.97
that will do will be	87.51
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same	144.71
do you indeed think so inquired the	146.66
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so	1375.75
then sir am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of marriage contract always injures the lady more than the	276.73
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in	1067.28
athos shuddered from head to	506.32
the son has been educated in college in the south believe near	665.97
merri you	814.30
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man will let the count know that you are	98.62
all crossed	2674.68
are you coming morrel directly have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us visit at rue meslay	297.72
oh what an abyss what an abyss cried	1240.43
to me to you to us take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have	194.19
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled	776.60
there ensued brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either	763.15
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the	185.26
hush said the captain it is	59.99
give me your arm and let us	32.14
the never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the	1472.05
no do not dance but like to see others do	281.82
the nails too were turning	7807.85
poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of	175.42
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for	178.22
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	156.72
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of	61.01
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to	203.95
we must seize the felucca said	234.91
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey	121.45
he shut the bedroom door him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had disagreeable	270.45
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch blood fell down	118.37
suppose you have blue ribbon in your pocket yes madame have that of the garter which king	260.59
am no relation of	385.54
monte cristo shuddered and	140.20
you too have been in england sir he said making sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue severe	187.05
but exclaimed monte cristo why was absent and why were you alone because you had been arrested edmond and were	166.83
and came sir added raoul gazing at the count with smile of real affection for thought you would be glad to see me	113.28
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of horseshoe and then as readily straightened	286.26
every one according to his nature my dear	124.65
albert and château renaud exchanged second look more full of amazement than the	315.07
athos and artagnan watched their approach from the	190.58
artagnan artagnan cried she is it you this way this way constance constance replied the young man where are you where are you my god at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to shock rather than opened several men rushed into the	173.10
simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off two year	987.99
when in house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held	483.74
it was superb moonlight	3295.03
ah my dear count you are far too	124.29
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier expression than by valentine	752.22
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses	143.89
moreover something had been said of marriage with mazarin	525.23
this is indeed the reason why begged you to alter the order of the	190.92
no felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and feel what it must cost	198.04
at length discovered that he went mysteriously to	463.26
oh if such thought could present itself would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored	489.61
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he	213.77
this key was furnished with small iron point negligence on the part of the	317.80
about that	61.29
am to say what you told me asked	45.62
hope have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here	101.17
ah indeed said	33.57
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the	407.98
yes said morrel it is true have but now left house where death has just entered to run to	128.98
and the steamboat she is at châlons	726.63
are you sure of what you assert what do you mean by that question understand sir do not in the least suspect your veracity ask if you are certain of it knew his	126.28
and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the	128.42
the footman mission was an easy	969.13
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to	444.67
oh yes said château	29.58
we have forgotten to mention that the count coachman was attired in bear skin exactly resembling odry in bear and the pasha_ and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who	857.15
it was ten clock when they	49.85
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter it is with that we have to do	115.60
athos had even gone so far as to	140.32
at last mastered my	3307.02
why should but still there are some signals only addressed to	361.78
that evening had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them second time with	289.94
presentation indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates	571.48
bonacieux where art thou do not leave me you see am dying artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	223.32
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear	360.05
now if you will come on	58.80
artagnan then perceived thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and	305.82
at last they reached the tennis	353.95
you will see the count again to morrow	113.86
he extended his hand and rang the bell	248.42
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles	262.48
there are yet five days left five days are more than	271.22
now to supper said	137.96
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon so much the better they must be good animals	126.30
incorruptible murmured artagnan am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind	239.66
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of	256.65
by whom by banker of paris my	915.94
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too	268.20
we must let them leave the village and ride us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite	201.99
there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring	332.42
the queen uttered cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her	93.10
this fox of fellow will be sending us hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this	996.14
and comforting one too added artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young	290.94
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in	82.96
but all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you	63.81
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join	284.36
all the preparations were made with frightful	445.72
have done with him all that could be	63.04
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal	965.20
in good	221.21
it was just two clock by albert watch when the two friends entered into the dancing	149.70
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should	104.37
laborer would not have done in day what occupied me an	135.86
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and	163.29
art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his	107.65
and said	30.97
hope said artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that am worthy of	101.89
he gives you his word of honor said	309.22
they took leave of each other and in ten minutes having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin artagnan was trotting along in the direction of	125.96
what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for	104.65
yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied	367.81
sire interposed the minister of police came moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which had obtained on this head when your majesty attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your	310.65
you promised to bring knife and to leave it with me our	240.93
and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the	223.94
what is that the precaution of changing our	156.34
ah what is that cried the	72.31
leave me alone said aramis	167.35
neither can we procure horses true we have offered any sum but have	832.19
yes replied aramis am extremely careful of my	328.68
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your	211.53
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was	205.01
which they deserve do they not believe they	221.95
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but have striven to repress	596.43
if you are young will be your comrade if you are old will be your	110.39
and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under folio of blank	882.57
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent	355.13
there was third point in view which will appear	721.15
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made most extraordinary	1548.49
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of	849.10
and should you see one whom you could prefer would not be so unjust have never seen anyone preferred to you and have never loved anyone but you and my	189.80
on entering the hotel artagnan saw man sitting in corner by the	151.57
you leave paris am going on	508.77
épinay became very pale he looked round him second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their	393.05
this action is somewhat too sublime to be	510.55
athos remained	1703.10
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and	261.28
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	220.99
few minutes twelve clock bernouin knocked at the queen bedroom door having come by the cardinal secret	411.94
you didn tell me of that	158.52
will join you again at	213.28
he was man about twenty two or twenty three years old but who appeared much older from ascetic	293.79
edmond resigned the lugger to the master care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of sleepless night he could not close his eyes for	198.30
and he again pointed to the bottles and the	135.37
you knew should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me no for saw god justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of	221.77
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos long cloak and artagnan rushed straight into the middle of	131.08
de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to	78.33
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped	267.44
de morcerf asked monte	28.07
called on fernand who sent me hundred francs by his valet de	197.71
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be	166.36
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of	294.59
lucien half	5010.21
no one could have said what caused the count voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he	476.84
and why not asked the young	34.70
who could know that was here already said the young	56.31
you are wounded asked buckingham as he opened the	119.33
gentlemen have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red	161.49
truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not who has consoled me in my sorrow but he on whom do my hopes rest on whom does my bleeding heart repose on him on him always on him yes you are right maximilian will follow	262.08
do not breathe word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this	132.56
villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed	161.25
and he mounted on the bench to try and get sight of	120.30
the abbess assigned her chamber and had breakfast	986.55
ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my	2907.89
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to loyal	459.53
well wife replied caderousse don know but what you re right so you will say nothing asked the	133.66
this appeared to be favorable opportunity to repair his	542.51
you appear to consider this point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your	119.31
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the	72.62
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten	115.22
and who was the winner	1352.22
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my	192.90
but of what disease then did she die asked	471.66
suspect hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal	495.23
the old man signified that he recollected	178.75
and know he has fought two duels said	522.85
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his	217.07
and yet what asked the	71.59
and perhaps you have preference for one boat more than	306.89
suffered that is	31.59
see gentlemen	49.61
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are	195.62
now he continued withdraw little and let me say my prayer beseech	437.42
he would not however yield immediately to the young man request but made few conscientious	518.82
know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with	94.07
yes we must put the madman with the	199.78
your majesty will not forget that have done everything in my power to prevent	129.61
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing grain of sand straw or breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of	914.88
our swords cried artagnan raising his head and regaining his self	247.38

these keys were given up to him	180.47
ali was stationed as kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by	368.39

athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young	123.72
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every	216.72
