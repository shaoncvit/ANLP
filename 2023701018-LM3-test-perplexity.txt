the water passed over his head and the sky turned	29.86
two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person declared could exculpate me if he	200.03
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one	147.83
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	109.62
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire	30.18
and what did monsieur artagnan reply monsieur artagnan promised me his assistance but soon found out that he was betraying	73.09
thank you said the young	5.90
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the	86.56
you are wrong	44.50
never once doubted your doing	47.75
when he arose second time he was fifty paces from where he had first	75.78
should hate and despise myself as coward did desert the brave fellow in his present	254.73
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter	210.96
silence said artagnan pressing her hand still more	44.86
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such war as that will restore you to liberty this moment will proclaim you piece of immaculate virtue will name you the lucretia of	171.89
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king	250.87
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to	190.64
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound	32.65
aramis affected laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out few words carelessly as he moved through the	411.41
but have nothing to fear while have you to protect	24.99
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at little village which was situated at the other side of the	105.73
pardon you for the death of poor felton pardon you for the attempts upon my own	46.10
now am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say	100.56
thank you said edmond with friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of	231.06
it was however necessary to affect weakness and pain not very difficult task for so finished an actress as	268.23
but four hundred what listen cried	19.26
exactly replied	63.14
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his	363.49
no monsieur and yet recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but	56.87
artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another	254.87
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind voice beside him said respect to fallen	170.53
thus for instance don you in the first place want horse yes	27.67
our former life has it still no attractions for you would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth do you propose to me to do so artagnan decidedly and	211.31
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think am going to change the life lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive volley of bullets all to earn paltry sum why have as much money as want mother assunta always furnishes me when ask for it you see that should be fool to accept your	888.13
this man might all be greater scoundrel than you have thought	230.66
but what if were mistaken shudder passed over	75.97
de tréville clock three quarters of an hour but thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon	88.19
no sir said artagnan and we place ourselves at your	37.32
let us consider first the ancient	120.89
the notary who was at the door immediately	18.29
it is true that when man possesses young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness	115.89
what is he contriving asked	400.20
and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied	114.10
the miserable villain he had foreseen	92.01
shall be at home till midday or if not will leave receipt with my	191.07
tell you the queen does not love me tell you she loves another tell you she loves that infamous buckingham why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke arrest the prime minister of king	138.95
but where shall go meanwhile is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you no can trust	173.26
in fact porthos did not appear for scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going	398.14
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert	950.32
benedetto the count son replied monte cristo astonished in his	28.14
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in quarter of an hour when voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him	169.40
de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the	17.70

in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality	331.30
from lyons to avignon still by	2237.96
those are indeed holidays to me go into the garden plant prune trim kill the insects all day	382.03
now valentine firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring	127.53
at the royal arms of england you will find young gentleman named	72.17
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of	189.42
there ought to be some money in that secretaire there may	92.59
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in	48.43
when you wish to obtain some concession from man self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound	89.23
and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of	95.54
debray said château	6.33
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his	122.11
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his	228.52
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their	145.27
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of	164.61
at this moment the boat came to landing with violent	50.07
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be	199.07
but at daybreak he	14.28
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in	192.99
indeed monseigneur responded the mercer have heard her pronounce all those	41.36
the host stood at the	33.93
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from	50.40
am not so sure of	22.89
but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the	92.60
terrible idea however rushed into her	53.51
oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do what to do there would be very simple means very natural tell me what to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	127.69
did you not yet know me come louise let us talk of our	79.39
tell you that you know these things as well as do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as doctor and as	67.36
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring full tide of silvery	256.20
edmond you have very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my	60.82
he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence four for	35.38
as for himself he dismounted and remained under beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on table which he found there conveniently	504.14
artagnan in his fortieth	5481.13
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right artagnan mouston will do mouston has very fine	241.18
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and	78.75
to give your majesty reply to those who await	42.75
corbleu let the civil war last but one year and will have constable sword gilt for	96.82
and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how tréville you know how delight in accounts of war and	236.76
this affair seems to me to have decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of great internal	424.69
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried artagnan you were all in the plot then and really don know what prevents me from exterminating you	687.12
and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said	59.25
hold your tongue imprudent man do you wish to destroy me you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since single word makes you tremble and you confess that if that word were heard you would be	138.39
wait my dear sir wait moment for have such delightful note on the quum traheret_ wait and will listen to you	321.39
let us go said she place full confidence in you my friend artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered artagnan	181.57
tell you marquis my fortune is made if only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service do	74.27
said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this	23.77
how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy thought dear valentine have not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas and you have am sure the fullest confidence in my	228.77
morrel had to pay within half an hour	44.27
the youth dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the	242.53
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his	53.21
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty	89.87
well all said artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other	147.06
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is	73.70
but as to free will aramis how acts the judge he has free will yet he fearlessly	160.63
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	240.37
noirtier room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old	49.12
at that moment burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	98.32
morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in coach with six	741.82
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen	208.57
yet the great sometimes repent of their	56.88
god who can read my heart all the gratitude feel will reward you save my husband save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when may be able to thank you	153.89
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was morrel who served in the same regiment with me when was in garrison at	154.41
yes returned artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the	53.77
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door	21.92
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost	58.55
oh yes it is you indeed from what he has told me know you	34.32
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that benefactor had arisen from the grave to save	178.41
adieu then edmond have nothing more to ask of heaven have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you	69.72
violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell	79.65
it had now become weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of	548.08
franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this	68.84
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count	67.85
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken	229.90
have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of	70.60
very well what did say to you that mazarin was contemptible and that wouldn serve	85.39
am convinced that if gave him box on the ear such as gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of	141.62
that is true but he will read petition countersigned and presented by	203.13
caderousse drew deep	70.60
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly was	139.33
well sir the rupture of blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in day not in an hour but in	139.03
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	97.64
flurry in stocks	789.28

cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me ask you what can do have tried to make you happy man and you have turned out	88.13
chastised monsieur said artagnan the expression is	17.79
have also sent for the	56.28
artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had	475.58
then do your best to keep our name free from	116.00
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the	138.54
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his	121.81

the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former	87.66
this was to go himself	7.61
he was less stiff than	928.03
and he assumed look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have	206.12
did you see the postscript did	77.16
have promised to escort to the académie greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her	235.67
understand he said you confess but confession made to the judges confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty the punishment exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur twice you have pronounced that word	225.59
it the same thing cried the young	15.12
but it must have	819.91
we must see what it is said	20.09
morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several	238.48
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten clock shall see what color his	50.45
circle was immediately formed around the	31.80

the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for dungeon but it is not that which wish to speak of but secret have to reveal of the greatest	164.17
tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of	187.34
felton leaned for support upon piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her	178.11
and he stepped on one side to give place to young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be	437.79
and this room he asked pointing to the captain	33.59
caderousse wrote the	129.25
caderousse more and more astonished went toward large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been	279.13
pooh said athos trying to smile in his	21.93
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of	168.67
when awoke fresh meal was	104.80
probably said artagnan but as he is thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his	263.79
fernand paleness appeared to have communicated itself to	71.46
one plays with anybody but one fights only with	224.48
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des	120.90
germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom artagnan had often remarked	58.18
tilted on one side of her head she had small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with	205.77
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer	893.39
my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the	68.30
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of drowning man uttered third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his	198.37
if should disturb rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an	124.59
then that is monsieur determination undeniably my	121.40
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in bedchamber which was at once miracle of taste and of	164.28
yes yes but let us talk of this	42.54
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather relief to the indifferent to see person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with father brother or	252.19
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been	138.98
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his	76.09
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him	48.31
zounds give way at these words the man with pistol and sword raised his head but it was too	102.41
foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain am not destined to return to beaucaire	145.38
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were	142.35
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de	59.63
the two brigands looked at each other for moment the one with smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his	88.08
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of artagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis	223.35
he held out his	19.59
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	28.27
and for myself monsieur shall saddle rustaud no take more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some	329.46
what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti	159.42
love young girl	46.38
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be	249.42
the captain	1173.77
but artagnan again shook his	23.29
you see we had each our mission said porthos mine was to guard you and am doing	90.30
the blush of pride mounted to the count forehead as this thought passed through his	112.02
here they are	158.25
made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down	140.34
the young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door them descended the rue des fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the rue des fossés monsieur le prince and did not stop till they came to the place	107.78
you may now	72.06
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience see an abbé cuffing man then bowing to woman it must be	235.19
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if	207.72
am afraid for the king safety place yourself close to the coach door on the	27.42
but they appear to speak french with very pure accent said	69.69
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic	802.71
encouraged by this invitation artagnan followed the duke who closed the door	33.23
besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and	71.18
he will come and visit the comte de la	10.53
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its	132.14
so suiting the action to the word artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the	106.70
the enemy army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out shelter to	583.97
and she is not to be despised in my	40.83
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with	153.67
the petition finished villefort read it	158.24
he inquired where they were and was answered by burst of	43.59
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever	120.69
what does the animal say asked the	14.31
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in frenzy of	94.65
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first	124.56
quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised	389.67
about half past	53.76
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot	202.34
judge for yourself replied	48.77
commissary said the brigadier tread in my	95.27
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even	130.35
what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his from him was lad of fifteen replied	108.41
why all these precautions you shall	22.37
lord winter you are not the king you are my	40.02
well be it so said	19.46
they are coming full gallop the prince is with them ah he is leaving them they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going	116.36
at length they reached the tent lit lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised artagnan with trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected	154.07
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it quite so my steward transacts all this business for	87.12
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with	33.34
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee	39.71
believe it is not said	242.15
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy brow little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of beautiful deep chestnut	730.90
every time he passed with friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real	314.77
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the	75.55
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass	25.16
have related it but once and that was to the abbé	18.67
at ten clock the king collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of	99.75

to the sword sir the sword and he jumped off his	14.03
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven clock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the	69.73
but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the	34.25
of the arabian	29.71
thank god am not bravo and being musketeer but for time only fight when am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is lady compromised by	173.33
we are about to ascertain sire replied artagnan as he rapidly left the	68.84
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young	38.76
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don let me detain	91.39
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their	120.60
franz pondered the matter for few moments concluded that man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of good supper	208.61
still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and	241.31
am sorry he does not speak french that might tender him my	128.58
good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with artagnan and both soon arrived at athos	162.84
in that case replied franz as shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to	223.30
fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon	298.21

felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired	94.40

then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had louis for his trouble and they went on their	218.19

but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman	476.46
there was no answer and she continued have not seen you all	37.44

franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of	119.27
thanks planchet thanks cried athos extending his hand to the	47.40
cannot answer for the	42.39
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	152.41
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching	43.48
she said that cried the cardinal with	26.90
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of	72.40
what monsieur you must give your recipe to	53.62
fanatic has just assassinated	27.34
do you really think so ah that would indeed be	88.02
morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at short	83.56
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that	67.26
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume warlike	244.52
jacques under verdant	2986.32
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an	28.95
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and	161.54
having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his	112.22
one by one the several groups broke	202.40
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like forlorn hope the road to the	208.57
but peppino did not	27.95
complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an	242.83
that devil porthos is man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good	275.85
they were both aroused at seven clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought letter for	109.01
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came	91.49
joy shone in raoul eyes and he leaped lightly to his	40.65
well what have to do with that why good lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the	211.60
rely on me to procure you the other will do my	24.61
it is excellent	53.59
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full	87.13
adieu thus tis quite decided said artagnan that what have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were any other man rejoined aramis but repeat am made up of	235.92
he aimed terrible blow at artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the	197.24
you are very fortunate said athos rising wish could say as much neffer replied the swiss enchanted that man like athos could envy him	228.08
still had loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in	43.29
what shall we do said	8.21
master friquet the owner of pistol and of sword which louvieres had given him had organized company of rogues like himself and was making tremendous	212.77
sir said planchet in mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate think if am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for	171.87
am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous	199.83
to the palais royal he called	20.04
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within quarter of mile of	250.92
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary terrible meaning for the	204.58
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not	238.00
and who has seen this de lis inquired	101.77
how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for did not even know of what was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first	93.18
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one	68.69
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by framework of	180.90
shall go he said to the	22.19
and now said artagnan to the	28.11

well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that am his	36.09
this side of your chamber looks out upon kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and	519.89
soon the two gentlemen stopped	22.89
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank	62.18
he then closed the door of the	36.40
the count watched him with feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in impartial_ who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name title of nobility and family	369.52
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own	154.88
so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are	189.62
mustered all my strength to reply to him with burst of	36.93
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten	53.57
you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was	27.19
from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the	27.31

mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the	51.44
come said artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse	131.59
what the knot for thought	152.11
in one second athos joined	68.41
andrea cavalcanti the young man in black coat looking at murillo madonna now he is	124.05

now that have the word of athos can set	11.55
franz lowered torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte	181.20
indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the	84.74

he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin he will consider us as	104.26
well if you should be restored to favor don forget	38.09

yes and that all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the	87.85
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by ball which broke his	122.47
doubt it my	187.41
de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz	29.59
you hear me at quarter past midnight in fact in twenty	37.39
he was carried home in the arms of the	30.28

my patron	4196.36
you called me didn you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the	120.34
why do you do so smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my	130.30
yes in single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to	137.45
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he	74.00
well well he has taken nothing	29.50
the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their	43.85

the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to	105.06

yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was great man very great man but he had that	82.87
in an instant all five were	101.41
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation	69.14

at three clock came two companies of the guards one french the other	67.39
sir we don keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay	90.39

as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining	176.34
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of little which had been already drunk	46.81
at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like	121.61
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the	19.51

noirtier do not complain for it is for you that came and my journey will be your	68.87
let us see what more does athos say should you meet on your journey certain monsieur mordaunt distrust him in letter cannot say	106.90
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister	414.07
and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself certainly not returned	161.69
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed	292.86

at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly	228.21
yellow boys said caderousse no thank	80.04
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed	324.97
so that monsieur watched bassompierre the king the duc angoulême and the	34.83

excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming	246.16
doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you my	28.89
then dantès departed for	169.75
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with smile upon her	34.58
it was scarcely eleven clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace	52.89
why not because feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would	95.22
it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven clock thought artagnan that settled	92.63
ah good evening my	12.50
age has warmed not chilled your	287.43
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure	88.85
de morcerf quick he is in hurry these words restored albert he darted from the room followed by the	65.78

the officer desired to have milady packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the	56.60
well my dear aramis you don want three horses cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore only purchased two said	113.83
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the	257.63
well said he in voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive friend with great deal of	220.51
the oubliettes of cardinal	9.56
let her humble herself then and come to me	49.81
the cardinal took the queen hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his	34.03
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my	47.11
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of	264.19
now as artagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced	114.73
he found him kneeling before with his head leaning on an open prayer	108.57
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornélie her confidential	54.07
suddenly he heard cry it was his daughter	24.77
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his	187.30
when return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as servant and upon your recommendation though he doesn speak word of french take him into my	170.68
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to	121.16
madame exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old never have seen you look so young so beautiful the duchess shook her	76.08

the snow was falling thick and	78.93
at this announcement of battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating word while the color gradually faded from her	324.53
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to	120.86
have some that is very	34.69
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said	92.05

the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the	45.76
sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false	208.23
thank god my child was not then dead no it was not	19.17
porthos seemed to breathe more	15.94
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address petition to some cold marble	825.93
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no	65.27
de monte cristo is our enemy replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered	79.60

the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such rage as was near costing him fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized spit his wife broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day	487.53

he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing	79.40
doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with	132.79
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the	90.47
upon what subject asked madame	41.39
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my	123.42

well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with red cross those were the count	55.91
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied	266.93
and what do you know about the state you talk of said	19.02
franz épinay observed	337.16

at this moment patrol passed	546.20
as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some	149.49
but putting his head out of the carriage eh planchet said	26.24
you understand that interested as am in this affair cannot see it in the same light as you	39.33
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly	151.78
the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the	90.99
the police had orders to make the strictest search for the	43.15
and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is crime fault or meritorious	203.42
what do you propose to me avrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my house impossible still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be	300.59

valentine valentine he mentally ejaculated but his lips uttered no sound and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion he sighed and closed his	162.81
no replied noirtier	102.66
and by what gate did they go out by the saint maur	71.18
and now am convinced said artagnan that this abduction of the queen woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in	81.10
on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydée had	49.56
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is	76.24
the major made wise choice he took the full glass and	71.19

mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon	142.32
then must give up the idea no we have them ready	60.74
do not overwhelm me with happiness cried artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	113.93

and said aramis imagined that had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom had made engagements which ought to have	132.63
do not say there is any truth in what am going to tell you but it is at least ray of light in dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more	182.49
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alone long enough since it had been useless one to	303.13
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup	277.37
shall ring for baptistin no will go and speak to him	62.48
passed the day and the night in prayer for hoped that god would pardon me my	38.59
no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his	153.80
the baroness did not wait for repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any	112.57
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some	516.88
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and	41.60
ho there boy have my valise carried to the muid amour rue des	284.75
what game shall find there thousands of wild	139.18

at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of	275.75
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with kind of fear he asked himself if having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire	1017.29
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important	197.49

as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were	79.59
and on what occasion she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the	50.58
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming	173.66
at vincennes tis true one lives faster my lord replied la ramee my lord or dies sooner for it comes to the same	142.41
trade oh maximilian how can you jest at time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself but listen to me valentine and will tell you all about	342.37

yes it is indeed	25.66
but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done	277.78
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the	144.03
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes	214.67
oh monsieur cried dantès you have been rather friend than	33.35
the catacombs of saint sebastian	160.64
well asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinière	118.63
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or	44.01
tomorrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as century at what hour does the examination take place at two	74.14
but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed	183.14
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone	25.02
but in coming too early should be afraid of awakening your	115.13
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these	278.54

well now will you return with me we are at your eminence	37.10
at the noise made by artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this	190.56
where can sleep on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our	165.03

she turned upon him no longer like furious woman but like wounded	70.44
de saint méran and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create reputation for	529.58
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be	24.08
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked	171.63
courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his	42.05
at length they arrived at the famous	37.84

and mordaunt darted out of the general tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with	77.79
take care said madame de villefort the king attorney is	19.91
the remembrance of the scene at	32.77
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of	191.87

dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the	70.94
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the	65.41

she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around	107.33
at last one day emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the	200.82
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse	250.84
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank	59.28
that will be	183.64
these francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and shall therefore act according to my	155.81
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an	334.78
what replied the	179.56
oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic	71.76
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in	344.84
had but one wish that was that he should kill	22.05
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough	297.22
épinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with albert and château	49.86
it is impossible said the	31.87
be easy said artagnan he will know all before	27.52
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only	42.07
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you will go and offer them two of our birds for	270.16
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis or to go and drink his health with their four other	172.87
you wish to remain alone	14.59
do look so asked the baron rising and going step	33.06
de villefort and his father exchanged	60.62
ah replied he guessing franz thought know this is serious	58.39
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work little more quietly the king wishes to get	202.66
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her	120.91
at this moment the door of the minister box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their	109.18
pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished really do not understand you	47.84
the dying man had signed deposition declaring benedetto to be the	97.38
which means that you now hesitate no do not hesitate god forbid but would it be just to allow me to go to possible death without having given me at least something more than hope milady answered by glance which said is that all speak	262.07
there what you want on that table said the	48.07
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of	27.86
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive	158.21
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his	257.31
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for	99.47
on the contrary stay monsieur artagnan your agreeable company will divert	43.28
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and are under such important	357.93
you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in immediately sought for information about that child as fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near	164.57

is your love returned suppose so said andrea with triumphant smile since am	194.63
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was	222.49
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me	197.65
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife fine well grown	68.97
as all this however bore some resemblance to duel artagnan began to recover himself little by	108.36
artagnan followed the with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where artagnan had	117.83
eh your excellency everyone must	22.56
attention then athos did not lose sight of the two	56.92
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via	35.60
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this	102.06
oh mon dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest	541.17
athos mounted more slowly speaking in low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their	197.93
by your father tomb said caderousse supported by supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of	179.76
man or woman	11.08
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you was going to make you the offer my dear artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such	104.85
you have friend monsieur du vallon whom like much let him accompany	48.62
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady	174.43
she is poor unfortunate greek left under my	120.12
prince cavalcanti said the latter prince cavalcanti where are you andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian	116.53

as long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every	156.95

monte cristo seemed in	204.87
you are at liberty to	63.09
gentlemen said	516.39
you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have	43.68
sir replied anne with degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police well sir you ought to know that we no longer have police since we are no longer at	223.91
be easy on that head replied athos you know am cool	57.81

artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	78.60
shall go and die by his	63.90
farewell then or rather revoir_ for hope we shall meet	48.97
this would have been method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do	144.62
trial it was stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till	187.68
he arrived at this end by his persistence in	258.57
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to	62.01
strength and sagacity	585852.91
at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom quarrel were not my	131.80
each of you take horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the	59.42
own that this woman terrifies	151.76
family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal family affair concerned	152.85
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with woman he	277.25
as to his title and fortune as to that madame have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs year and the title of	99.88
that my concern will make him	39.94
porthos turned rather pale and drank off large glass of	67.43
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his	35.04
well said artagnan answer that while there remains drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor	151.04
she may have forgotten	339.74
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to sigh which sounded more like	180.79
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search his lackey than he had had the night	160.44
oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his	176.50
the letter shall be given to	19.73
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs artagnan remembered he had forgotten his	116.71
he had taken the silence of the old man for return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria so painful crisis seemed to indicate serious relapse into mental	294.70
will candidly explain the reason of both and trust to your goodness to pardon	39.91
so artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in	321.56
he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three	23.87
athos look at mordaunt	59.50
never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	27.86
it was almost triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed	143.07
has no one owned him no one his parents are	232.27
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own	89.56
will you come said he to	37.25
ah don be angry beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and	59.84
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their	134.12
besides you forget that have ring	76.16
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives	87.04
and those of the first floor you know they are never	60.95
épinay consented to our all living together	123.61
besides she felt as we feel when storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be	94.91
excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but	78.63
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this friends answered charles sadly have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of week standing whom shall never	156.48
the same perhaps said	17.02
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to	55.20
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	179.33

hitherto have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not	365.63

yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged you have my word said he for the second time give you your	68.13
ali as my	6632.99
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the	701.59
that very simple replied	14.62
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two	25494.32
ah cried artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and have such fear that it should fly away from me like dream that pant to make reality of	206.97
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom owe my introduction to the	90.94
that all right	56.80
doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your	223.87
yes sir continued the inspector of	36.00
artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in few minutes cahusac fell with sword thrust through his	162.75
monsieur implore you do not stay there think you are going mad bertuccio said the count	77.79
he will guess at	30.72
do what	1163.43
wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the	24.25
what you one what have you done with her then if you have her no longer they have abducted her	46.06
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti	63.97
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce	85.36
well said porthos replied	6.22
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on first affair you are in great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to	287.77
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de	64.11
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his	177.97
on beholding this house artagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of	186.41
another proof that he was native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic	270.14
wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed artagnan with look of astonishment what danger am told that there is general	315.65
ah he quite another sort of person formidable gentleman	162.50
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that would mention the appointment to no one muttered	84.73
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still	86.00
de tréville that all very	25.76
ah porthos cried one of his companions don try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal	225.92
hem replied	17.69
have mercy on my child sir murmured	55.15
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	28.68
then you will lie here said	28.43
monsieur aramis is not an officer asked the queen of lord de	25.18
artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp	187.67
and you as for me am quite sure that turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers shall not find ten louis at	126.93
can tréville have set this gascon upon me he is very young but sword thrust is sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into reverie which lasted some	317.58
if man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed being who when torn from you left desolation wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with few moments of physical pain yes know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to	611.37
scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine have just had wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom little expected to see	384.43
unfasten it or will break it in said	29.61
here is what you are looking for he	12.79
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the	33.78
but this secret is not mine and cannot reveal it in this	63.86
and we say proud as gascon replied	17.16
then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been barony by my	156.96
the first three remained constantly in small waiting room ready to obey the summons of small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to	343.62
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new	68.88
my father	62.37
one day we received	83.17
oh monsieur thank you with all my	21.46
what must answer the	105.16

well then answered aramis pray tell me day or two beforehand that may take that opportunity of going to	100.85

halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers fighting here are you and the edicts what is become of them you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding	231.30
will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them	52.40
am stranger and stranger to such degree that this is the first time have ever been at	42.04
have you carriage	76.33
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault stories who present themselves unbidden at wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and	1009.82
mercédès read albert while showing you that have discovered your plans hope also to convince you of my	260.65
milady uttered cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefort the demoniacal tool of his	313.63
as to the king he made no demonstration of politeness only stopping before the	58.21
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	129.26
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring dangerous	220.20
do you see that street there are the	59.63
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great	154.27
he had not seen	204.74
what was his name asked monte	10.40
artagnan went toward very small low window just large enough to let man	107.79
certainly not replied the	30.18
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if did not know that something is going on in yonder house and he pointed to magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now	339.73
will our help come from you	27.06
ah said the priest in marked italian accent yes have heard that death is in that	38.80
but swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me will kill myself while accusing you of my	103.67
de saint méran had always expressed desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family	116.21
the same as yesterday another nod on the part of	70.12
one word more said monte	14.33
bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper	27.92
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood	56.18
noirtier seating himself might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the th of february and on the rd of march you turn up here in	121.30
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her	184.23
felton had not	398.44
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed handle but that had been	88.63
indeed he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais	30.04
to certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be general of the army what do you think of the plan gentlemen admirable replied the young men in	104.22
indeed said artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your	123.47
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and	21.25
she had son that unhappy woman	23.95
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering	233.37
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	71.75
ah sir said artagnan you have wicked	97.10
that is possible	332.70
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks	115.44
indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him	67.02
then we must fly said	21.61
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the	64.61
tell me may shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must simply propose to you choice of arms albert said beauchamp with look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and	347.62
do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said	24.22
no for	2978.23
those who have once beheld such spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of wintry	612.15
nothing is lost	88.35
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she	277.35
no returned monte cristo only	46.82
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as proof of what say here is mine in my	182.14
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was sorrow and voluptuousness torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like	584.12
your home is paradise porthos one takes no note of	122.46
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over	32.25
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime	123.28
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend	103.84
think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that	205.15
athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head	153.74
yes my lord answered the	63.75
artagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his	61.69
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the	40.92
here sire tell you to the left and you are looking to the right mean on my left yes	46.08
fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of	610.45
ah added the count in contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of	152.94
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the	115.18
what that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery that the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the	93.74
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has	190.48
true said caderousse benedetto has become the son of great	26.12
now then what had better do return	65.95
the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight	264.59
on his wife	1598.53
what would you have said	14.77
and who wishes to speak with me who wishes to speak to lady recently come from	96.42
in the first place warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find	53.45
what without chastising this insolent boy asked the	269.34
as for monte cristo this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal	139.15
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his	118.26
bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in hoarse voice his excellency horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward	105.10
my father is king attorney replied andrea	36.98
athos chose black coat which gave him the appearance of respectable	136.25
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman am going to fight with said athos pointing to artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same	59.69
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led joyous	89.36
on my soul handsome stirrups bazin come here this	195.50
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with	540.62
but come what is this about asked	15.32
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army	151.10
thanks my	68.57
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the	332.85
we can therefore use up four horses as well as	32.57
no said felton it is	33.12
the king is alone with few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself	154.04
saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the	95.93
but when the cardinal added that not only	22.42
ah ha whispered monte cristo with smile of disappointment he is only	192.57
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded	103.12
knew you were	597.59
oh do not do that excellency have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in	86.92
the count soon heard the rattling of bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the	500.68
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following	177.26
valentine smiled but it was evident that she	52.34
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of	470.15
athos and aramis kept themselves to their	96.69
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father heart beat	120.35
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are	140.82
they are all here said caderousse	86.62
the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the	26.72
but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your	377.04
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth do not feel any particular desire ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing	752.06
sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left	46.02
how do you know that my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of	42.85
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which artagnan is blindly	206.09
he awaited mazarin promised visit to get some light on his present	121.93
in week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on field of	234.41
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother and this bed with red hangings bed visited by the goddess lucina and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered groan and	484.94
have you provided yourself with money assure you intend to play the devil game to	60.04
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of	52.42
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in	40.79
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom asked you was said to bear the name of	33.15

de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de	111.82
became very pale felt my legs fail me sought for reply but could find none was	153.73
you see then why must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month end nothing is gained or	289.11
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which had to reply called for	35.66
wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their	42.77

de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois	26.79
and how shall know whether your excellency has succeeded or	52.34
the count cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his	118.07
do you then love me oh valentine he asks if love	61.23
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle	256.34
but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and	167.47
let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her	50.95
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ah nonsense cried artagnan can manage so that her majesty will receive me well know an excellent	283.07
do you think the thing possible everything is	8.12
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and am too good master to allow you to miss such chance by granting you the dismissal you	160.86
depraved as girl adulterous as wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and	438.78
it was empty and dantès emerged from the	155.37
we will describe the thing to him as consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off	52.08
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter mean that shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of	162.30
zounds exclaimed artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid let him have his say artagnan said athos with smile of sadness and	263.88
and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the	160.94
poet as am am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to	252.41
galley slave escaped from confinement at	34.85

with this design he had engaged box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate	181.36
very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality	96.57
ah is it you mordaunt said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may	40.52
but how can pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with	106.25
let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so	208.20
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to	108.15
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy	148.96

to think of the parisians soliloquized artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for hundred thousand	381.80
opened the door of the ante room myself and saw you enter at the end of the	21.04

villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter	252.09
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward	241.36

the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual	195.20
understand said athos but why not porthos should have thought that his duchess oh porthos duchess is dressed by her husband clerks said artagnan	237.59
they are hot royalists said	339.06

he was struck by sudden	61.00
we were speaking of	93.76

and what is fronde inquired	17.65
thirty five	120.30
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to	76.08
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take loaf two cutlets and bottle of	249.01

but humpbacked general under the cuirass the hump will not be	1286.98
madame he said to the duchess have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive	112.59
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by movement of rotation explained by the persistency of	211.53
yes said	12.94
morrel my thanks are	165.17
he made sign which understood but the king guards must have noticed it and held themselves on	99.69
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor not so loud father entreat of you for your own sake as well as	34.59
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do	24.95
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of forgotten	64.72
well do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our	147.49
just then patrol rode	557.97

it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to	318.29
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to	36.33
he recollected the call he had made upon him the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine	77.96
they then	3083.85
so then said athos offering his hand to	26.93
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police ask you what you know of	102.57

no it would delay me and need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me	37.28
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the	63.83
de tréville nor the musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to	73.16
as to the government of normandy replied the queen think can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal	79.89
and the troop continued their	48.07
it was caesar commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these	310.92
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in	119.29
but dress yourself	24.44
she was stone	101.09
the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with	201.72
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he	55.30
now for the tally	21940.38
pooh replied porthos am what	15.46
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered	59.70
but recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to	256.31
come come give it to me what strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his	43.13
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said	113.45
monsieur abbé you are great	121.56
no said	9.06
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful	451.89
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his	47.30
this is the mystery said	23.17
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see	392.45
the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly	75.42
say have poor father	15.14
presently they heard milady retire to her	38.01
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something	64.78
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he	147.43
while singing milady	707.31
and make la ramee eat the pear answered	105.70
artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos pleasant dwelling	123.95
yes monsieur said artagnan bowing we have had that	51.44
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or	120.09
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in	66.79
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in mid	199.55
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of	73.85
what is it you edmond back again said he with broad marseillaise accent and grin that displayed his ivory white	492.27
noirtier said avrigny am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to	134.09
let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat	111.02
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the	58.03
ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe thought it was for something	49.03
now resumed grimaud ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest	194.46
saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to	115.00
there is no doubt they went thither to fight	84.60
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as	239.60
now where are you going to brussels if you like it is the nearest	43.31
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same	173.45
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this	166.05
then taking the glass with firm hand she said	31.26
planchet repeated aramis and	11.95
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is	58.72
there was doubtful expression in noirtier eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing	162.16
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting	1364.42
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting do for instance fare better well wait patiently do not yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the	491.75
artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	75.66
all at once his ear caught sound resembling that of stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself	202.35
at the same instant his ear caught sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness	760.31
are you sure of it he showed it me but that is not all there is codicil as said just	56.61
maximilian who was paying them visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of	192.62
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	208.83
providence has declared for us since have found this brave man again in so miraculous	131.76
should dread some disagreeable encounter if were to go	199.90
so thought the gascon here young blade who has already his love affair who doesn at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair	138.10
once more replied the	93.61
aramis stooped to kiss the king hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his	53.14
the beginning or the end the evening of the	21.13
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily	159.21
ah absurd they don burn sorcerers	392.75
might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but did nothing of the sort suffered him and his band to	163.48
de chavigny who according to report was son of richelieu and had been creature of the late cardinal understood	157.19
milady had then made breach by her false virtue in the opinion of man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of man hitherto chaste and	198.58
at châlons was put upon the saône thence passed on to the rhône whence descended merely with the current to arles at arles was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to	289.71
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to	141.38
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much	46.28
unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one hope pronounced no name for knew none except his mother as young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her	453.00
sheathe then if you please and follow	21.71
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	76.87
artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe	205.14
how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dantès whole attention was riveted on man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of	423.53
five minutes had sufficed to make complete transformation in his	263.39
wretch cried artagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me woman whom don know but who is called	84.98
andrea read in low voice you are poor miserable old age awaits	81.10
artagnan who though wanting in practice had sound theory redoubled his	149.67
so that now inquired the	18.68
they are destined to produce at least	81.32
of course that is perfectly just	33.66
that will keep us from going away from the east whither am tempted to think have been conveyed by some good	251.57
the past the count departed with sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her	72.43
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was painted	232.52
in that case said bazin he must be pretty	53.54
she was talking with great animation with the	88.67
and why asked scarron is he not man of good birth	53.58
that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to	68.52
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived considerable body of horsemen about half league	158.04
but my dear count	52.81
bah said artagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride the carriage and exterminate those who may be in	165.33
de morcerf will kill	17.56
which is the young man asked de winter turning	25.33
to which of us asked all the four	17.39
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des	127.47
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly	240.62
whether am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way	25.83
he then made sign for mousqueton to come to	20.05
what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we	22.71
want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	36.84
it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten clock if he did not return by ten clock she was to	84.67
she was tall woman with slender figure and forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens	551.51
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did	270.50
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by long	215.44
mousqueton said artagnan you must render me	27.73
the queen uttered piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by	68.81
here said the prince handing him purse here is for	104.45
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us invite you with good	79.69
which he had occupied on his last stay at	132.48
this time there could be no doubt artagnan was really	60.86
it is his way and you must take him as you find	20.18
they were his friends and not	78.08
what was it then it was an	52.25
let us see the watch said	15.78
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their	114.34
the king closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis	282.08
meantime artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	47.24
well laporte asked the	21.12
you know it don you no sing it	48.03
and by the rapid glance that the young man eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this	264.31
yes particularly if you follow the instructions am about to give	19.41
murmured he growing still	473.66
what clock is it the baron drew out his	24.73
from my earliest recollections have been beloved by no one so much the worse that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of	157.28

what dost thou there rascal asked	342.61
ah diavolo he exclaimed forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of	239.73
you have deceived me said the cardinal	27.72
the vendomois road he	61.61
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural	330.88
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its	375.86
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes am really	53.12
had been warned by the authorities that celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or	310.35
having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his	40.76
he then concluded it must be an	83.97
the same said	20.47
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on certain	62.48
andrea had	1021602.05
thought as much said artagnan wasting his strength in useless	140.45
now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with	31.72
you came from country where he must be very much talked of and know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the	203.04
monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his	120.77
let me see your plan dare say it is pretty	54.70
five minutes the door keeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and said beauchamp shared the general expectation and	81.57
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring and at the caprice of the	160.73
do not send you away but you have had the small pox and am afraid that sitting up late may tire	130.71
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were	127.49
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her	31.17
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and	89.56
what did you say sir asked the	17.87
table ready set out awaited	30.96
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means	196.31
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is dead nation he wished to find method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though place great confidence in busoni am not responsible for	445.71
it would be fatal to his	42.65
then he will be able to give us an answer	62.98
to horse said lord	12.26
come reflect and	195.66
our family although still rich for my father income amounts to half million has experienced many misfortunes and myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years have not seen the author of my	218.26
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour	265.34
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to	45.36
milady secret artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this	376.17
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and should have news from those without the prison	106.80
yet replied beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity	547.26
for one second artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping portion of his face was uncovered and artagnan recognized the	110.85
there do you see madame he recognizes you and	154.79
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor	160.51
but once again that gentleman where is he what has become of him is he dead is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to	113.44
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as	155.96
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring	542.75
the young man was overwhelmed as he	21.26
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond	154.46
but you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged you are the master and could not have the least word to	38.65
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his	48.92
are we threatened with fresh reign of terror asked	164.82
peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless explain myself in	390.05
the other was large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal	143.87
ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck door your fortune is	65.55
we shall wait for you artagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear	22.67
at noon they rode into the avenue of	151.44
take care you assert great deal said	36.56
well he told me that benedetto who is considered serpent of subtlety and giant of cunning is really but very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs his	665.45
yes they sent me the order of charles	9.84
old dantès was dead and mercédès had	28.53
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your	111.99
is it not so eh who knows never mind said milady writing the name on half sheet of paper will compromise	128.24
what end would that answer to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were	166.80

but all three reflected upon the youth of artagnan and dreaded his	97.76
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this	73.71
certainly and why should regret what gives you pleasure oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian hand and can set out immediately when you like	116.85
along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing	63.43
the youth brought small	936.54
the fact was that emery son had run great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had	194.96
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of truly great character on all that surrounds	86.27
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is	390.94

he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of bishop who introduced him to his eminence as perfectly devout	540.28
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the	81.91
why because you met him at my house just his introduction into the world as they told	68.40
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where artagnan was	177.88
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was	104.64
the procurator repeated several times ah madame coquenard accept my compliments your dinner has been real	124.45
no shall go incognito count under the name of marie	116.16
and to that friend say during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint méran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but could also specify the	193.20
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to	67.66
zounds replied artagnan why don you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch ah comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands your son as you call me will not let you twas the first time artagnan had ever refused request from	323.87
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be	193.95
the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to	140.85
whereupon grimaud observing the duke disappointment drew from his pocket purse filled with gold and handed it to	96.20
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite	64.04
then should advise you to leave off wearing that style of	90.41
half pistole if you can find out said	54.84
but am not selfish and thought it might console you all little to have share in the	73.47
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès	246.75
it was only	1425.37
monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea	171.06

his eyes therefore were fixed in sort of agony upon the door through which the king must	60.92

they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from	52.00
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part protest that should ever go to corsica my first visit ere even presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are race of men admire	865.01

and in half an hour said maximilian in gloomy voice our name is dishonored blood washes out dishonor said	178.79
nothing bad has happened to him then absolutely	22.37
the sergeant burst into fit of	11.73

he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and	113.58

and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and was so to	62.29

at the sight of the diamond which was as large as hazel nut la carconte eyes sparkled with	67.10

monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk much monsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own	265.01
the door opened and dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed third remaining at the door with torch in its	121.99

madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is	148.85
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present pair of horses worth francs to madame danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey	500.60

blaisois tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé herblay and in spite of bazin assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such manner as to put bazin into	334.86
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted	46.33
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieur artagnan that have received heavy and serious complaints against	222.45

sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying	57.89
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were	548.18

but monsieur said mousqueton can swim let me stay	64.18
you know madame how suddenly snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched is it then so terrible poison oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary	393.13
that workmanship is divine he	242.05
franz glanced rapidly towards the three	31.96

when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on artagnan but more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his	170.69
but how inquired am to maintain myself and my poor sister person whose confessor am replied he and who entertains high regard for me applied to me short time since to procure him confidential	258.27
mercédès said the count do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed	94.92
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at	48.82
de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than foreign princess who was enormously fond of	274.47
you are right you know men better than do and what you say may possibly be the case confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances prefer not to know it because then should be forced to hate	155.04
has any horse got loose not likely answered the gascon these marks are	156.65
shall help you madame asked	25.36
this will be added noirtier with smile one means by which you may second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me	268.53
oh no monsieur artagnan said raoul you are such brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you eh egad love me too will not torment you much but only on condition that you become frondist my young friend and hearty frondist	215.16
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in	37.35
without further explanation artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu	117.51
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards	104.44
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress	296.69
because he plainly perceives that his piquette stands in need of being enlivened by mixture of good	400.14
she opened her eyes looked around her with terror saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her	46.93
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest	95.88
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the	171.92

have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by queen yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and	187.57
bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other	127.83
oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than mistake feel quite	113.77
at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not believe	40.35
but parry withdrew thinking he was	107.74
oh attend to it valentine entreat	17.71
in the midst of this avenue was nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on tall	144.47
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for gentleman that of the	91.01
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous	431.49
was the gascon determined to keep it as weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as last resource for his outfit it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of	423.84
artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat single	124.00
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not	33.65
well sir returned mazarin prudence is fine thing but to day you might regret having been too	249.73
and you ate in your carriage asked	67.87
yes and give them chance of escaping said	41.71
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too	89.69
by her step she must be young perhaps she is	43.39
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or	385.83
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him real affection never ceased recommending him to the	89.03
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but	504.79

so can said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his	25.13
that is my opinion said	9.93

he was on villefort premises had arrived there by scaling the	171.51

child who will be of age in four	21.46

he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under	235.93
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other	108.97

call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in low	73.74
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked	121.12
dragged myself as far as the	47.70
when he came here monsieur artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order suppose to have his sword	185.27
and with movement of impatience he turned to retrace his	167.58

artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their	325.73
dantès rose advanced few steps and with fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than	181.70
the return chapter	197.93
let us speak	21.89
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like	347.48
and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own	71.97
you here rochefort he said in low	32.40
it is eleven clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king	116.93
he remained there some time	53.15
the procurator wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	44.51
where does he come from the end of the world farther still	21.16
the very	185.03
de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows	201.31
are you for mazarin or for the princes am for no	15.74
ha ha answered porthos behold other players	204.70
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his	207.48
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with malady of the skin which worries him to death and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in very short time the usurper will be	260.53
edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside	35.84
yes keep it keep	20.77
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the	329.00
it was good	1293.89
madame cried	73.14
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take	18.18

as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard	42.17
monsieur shall see that upon occasion have some left only beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last	132.07
aramis at this movement drew his	17.99
well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay nights seven clock in the morning you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going	267.63
also know that her name is valentine and have already prayed for	38.15
why in truth sir was monte cristo reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through solar microscope but you said think that had nothing else to	302.48
the abbé sank upon edmond bed while edmond himself remained	84.67
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty	140.95
it is even probable that shall have to make	65.92
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is	50.67
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which have made of man of marseilles whom have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my	112.30
an instant dantès	423.17
sire stammered the	87.45
how not much twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the	98.16
he was	211.64
noirtier playing with	198.95
thus speaking he fell back	81.51
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were	130.19
then the inconvenience became	71.48

well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and must go and find	86.34
noirtier was true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had	199.67
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor	63.46
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as summer cloud seemed physiognomy of absolute	199.82

what was there in it letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the	52.27
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with tranquillity and candor of	69.97
morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor very well as far as could judge from the sight of	58.50
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of	347.01
he was dressed in common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian	439.67
now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of man perfectly well satisfied with	119.04
the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant	196.42
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron right hand with his left and held out his other	195.01
it was artagnan who now shook his head in his	24.32
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of million to	121.28
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winter inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without	314.89
count have reflected on the matter said franz thank you for your courtesy but shall content myself with accepting place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del	150.75
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio	48.26
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related because have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the	127.68
de villefort	574.84
the caves of the	29.99

no no it is an infernal apparition it is not he help help screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her	104.33
and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to	46.94
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from	67.71
shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of	47.13
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their	181.26
your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my	144.01
forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that	49.71
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at	45.74
true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that acted like	31.74
said albert the engagement is broken	27.05
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in person of his years and light and steady on his feet as cat or lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command perfect view from top to	319.55
yes said the physician repeat it she is still alive and am astonished at	25.69
but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will	89.86
she cried out but avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been	222.29
the lions den	855.67
don suppose that our friend artagnan has added any of his own to the	63.92
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven clock and to bring	71.36
yes and will tell	14.32
artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged	170.00
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext	88.78
the heart of the young man overflowed with	221.23
of me will engage to say that before week is past the door will be closed against	49.60
but what step would you propose to me could propose one to your majesty but dare	50.85
nay madame pray you pardon this little	133.82
but artagnan had reckoned without the	139.47
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final	337.90
yes doubtless have promised to give my daughter to man who loves her but not to one who does	45.21
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandré was irrevocably	445.17
from friquet know that name son of monsieur de broussel servant and lad that promise you in revolt will not give away his share to the	236.03
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments word thrown forth occasionally with violent effort was the share athos furnished to the	105.46
and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave artagnan to act as he thinks proper said	64.19
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had	91.62
supposing also should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per	260.40
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg	251.70

ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears see that am condemned to die no valentine for have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon noble heart but to insure this you must rely on	325.61
general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor	19.39

any noise in the ears	316.14
they continued their	61.48
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is	67.58
he made great start and looked at	24.46
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the	114.69
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place	343.50
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by too extravagant	363.25
ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	195.02
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her	83.72
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary	28.97
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to	37.51
but would you believe it he was not	194.56
dantès noticed that the captain of jeune amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw four ounce ball thousand paces or	334.05
the old man declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless	159.99
andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the	74.64
for while nothing was heard in the room but succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to	391.72
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his	96.63
nevertheless you come as one in	77.99
shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo wait for	20.60
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was	65.92
yes have said it and now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent	715.53
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by single	119.65
have enemies replied dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for	74.52
not scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his	149.23
will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his	46.74
athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his	110.82
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such	271.12
and you will pay ready	47.16
so artagnan resumed you will not become partisan of mazarin nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor	153.40
with heavy heart artagnan again bent his way toward the	68.75
briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day tomorrow at two clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great	145.67
here cried porthos here porthos foresaw that if artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the	148.19
from that time looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for particular	107.90
it is well returned the voice	37.66
bring hither that	110.26
don know what you mean nor do even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous creature the more so as you tell me this artagnan is libertine duelist and	196.16
de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable	675.37
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the	163.11

yes no	45.65
artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from false position like that of man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in conversation that does not concern	294.28

the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was	56.67
but on my soul it looks	28.95
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled	82.04
these considerations naturally gave villefort feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its	402.82
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said felton with increasing	146.68

you have had proof of that in what you have just related to	22.64

this manœuvre was to	807.01

what you say is perhaps true they know my	74.05
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the	82.72

what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking	375.24

two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was	327.77

what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so	136.46
was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting captain themselves feel convinced their choice would have fallen on	214.04

scoundrel murmured	332.35
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that great catastrophe hung over the morrel	94.85
at the expiration of minute or two it appeared to artagnan	23.76
slight movement of surprise escaped	56.86
you will not reply however and these gentlemen am sure will presently be of my	67.27

deathlike silence oppressed all	694.43

the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five clock in the morning until nine clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be second	308.35

in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into small compass had the form of cylinder and was not easily kept	216.23
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that	308.31

alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear	129.45
of course cried	57.06
artagnan replied in such manner that kitty remained in her great	115.81

if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	141.48
here was the officer artagnan was	18.96
the name of your ship inquired	25.20
the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations	372.34
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of	117.38
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès the manner of labor saving pioneer dug mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made match by rolling his handkerchief in	530.92

my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived	77.87
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to	32.01
yes said athos by his own	41.39
but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his	192.44
yes monseigneur said	13.55
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving artagnan composure that as have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your	85.28
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also	315.39
his house has he built one here then no but he has very comfortable one all the same so they	131.00
well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying	178.59
know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept	55.49
he kept his word twice day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with	320.88
in one hour the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with	464.55

bonacieux the one he had just picked	29.30
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	135.62
years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of artagnan at	109.29
what shall say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst artagnan and porthos stepped	208.33
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of	897.43
scarcely had artagnan uttered these words when ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the	141.95
morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such lively sensation and to beseech him to make	161.25
the young man was opening the door of the	22.53

the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and presented as warlike an	90.91
artagnan came again on the morrow and the day that and each day milady gave him more gracious	107.50
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the	244.86
how it is sometimes essential to government to cause man disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their	614.49
and now the ranks began to	20.97
in the place of the palais royal artagnan saw sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred	115.02
oh beautiful life yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy days my love my blood my life all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing look at the gold which sparkled on the	232.13
it was then part he was playing yes my	41.04
the latter made sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf are you not no replied madame danglars am too	88.52
will appeal to any of these gentlemen could leave my guest in the hands of hideous bandit as you term him besides you know had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when came to	257.42
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally	165.89
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on impartial_ the paper of which beauchamp was the chief	185.81
he is also the bearer of second confidential epistle for his	105.56
soho cried	122.58
well said the young woman what you dreaded has	15.13
he then	1418.83
de villefort in condemning culprit to death	118.55
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by forced smile that you have already got horses	238.41
am sure he will look like the great mogul they made halt for an hour to refresh their	205.81
willingly answered the duke give me the pie am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to	229.56
as the door closed them kitty rushed toward	17.71
why she inquired in hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to	208.40
he is at	153.55

advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	40.73
there and	5419.11
martin with his garrison and threw hundred men into little fort called the fort of la	128.87
artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens past danger particularly when the danger seems to have	142.95
this personage	37.59
bertuccio said the count am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like man possessed by devil who will not leave him and have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is	262.44
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with gentleman and they treated him like very	67.39
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the	245.88
then he had eaten some without saying word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the	616.88
then fearful crash was heard cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said	134.06
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made sign that artagnan and porthos should give	71.87
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for moment he had hoped to carry it	94.61
that pretty little whom artagnan had already observed then came	38.08
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can do for you mordaunt reflected moment and some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this	330.93
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	109.32
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the	121.54
foi_ yes like you hesitated but the count eloquence decides	49.07
feel the same as regards	145.25
artagnan turned to	109.42
marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound	18.85
well for the king service we need	38.85
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by	208.53
why do you doubt the past that obscurity on the	13.71
why it seems to me replied morrel that in	85.64
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted kiss on it but she herself felt that it was kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of	207.52
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself	141.41
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that	307.55
we are first said morrel looking out of the	87.02
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini account of vampa having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing	350.80
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them	110.39
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	91.33
really then that person is most amiable	14.30
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not know	61.36
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are	108.40
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden	84.33
and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his	140.16
but there are four against you leave off command	35.08
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his	403.80
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that shall probably be skinned never mind ll fix that all	273.75
porthos was in bed and was playing game at with mousqueton to keep his hand in while spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the	474.43
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length valentine	66.48
the two gentlemen then went into the	30.84
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were fool not to have pretended to accept the	78.96
the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in low tone to de winter if you need money my lord separate the jewels have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some	142.15
artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering fervent prayer to	257.57
what milady has he not come said	32.97
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and	112.43
artagnan and porthos withdrew to corner of the	72.74
danglars waited moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his	82.49
see your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the	147.42
they had expected maximilian since the previous	12.80
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his	62.28
well said he let us go to valentine will give instructions to everyone and	70.73
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked	80.14
too cried mousqueton saw them	25.43
yes sir and as he said it was an ancient	32.06
let us load the	1017.51
ah reverend sir cried caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to monte cristo may indeed say you are my deliverer you mean to say you have been freed from confinement yes that is true reverend	440.42
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting	189.13
everything lies in the	6279.48
porthos and mousqueton each took horse by the bridle and proceeded to their	22.93
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for minute by last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in	167.63
zaccone are the same absolutely the	2.85
how what do you say cried	14.30
how can that young woman whom the queen took out of	31.57
mordaunt remained standing near the	26.54
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousse glass and do not interfere with	119.83
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron	264.88
you have no idea then morrel asked château renaud you do not propose	67.48
we shall	182.93
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet	174.20
she looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at artagnan with an air which said you are very amiable no doubt but you would be if you would only	153.08
the parliament we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament both orleans and montargis are	95.44
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my	210.70
monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open	65.89
don ask me for counsel don tell me you are perplexed what to	138.24
yes said the king but do not wish to be touched by any of those	29.59
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his	91.12
never play for am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to	78.76
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back am	42.51
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the banker shoulder people pay here before they	124.15
come milady opened the window and made sign to	19.09
but this war may bring round peace this peace will require negotiator that negotiator will be	225.69
beauchamp replied	2481.02
this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo	299.54
they may tell us to open	28.91
don know english athos said artagnan but you know it and will interpret for	58.79
de tréville who detected him at	164.38
ah but you are joking my worthy man said	39.37
when saw you at your chateau at bragelonne made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as friend you played with me as child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your	383.92
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and	999.01
and also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the	110.87
ah indeed and when child often played with the son in the timber	110.01
the next day about nine clock in the morning he landed at	29.23
owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of	95.67
do you know him do	14.51
short and	52579.02

it was chaise drawn by three horses driven by postillion rochefort lackey would precede it as	282.51
thank you sir what am about to ask will not compromise you in any	76.07
the hungry friends followed by their lackeys were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity in order to reap few in time of	469.62
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive	81.09
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and	186.48
de blacas wiped the moisture from his	65.54
who does not love you valentine smiled	24.80
the next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit saint	63.81
by the light of lantern the coadjutor recognized	33.86
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are	158.72
he could not help thinking	12.45
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante	11.77
oh less than nothing said aramis charming little seamstress whom love dearly and from whose hand requested few lines as sort of	339.67
do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel arguillon which is full of the cardinal creatures how do know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head now entertain ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so	239.65
but his bath asked	2930.11
then what may it be to call for monsieur le	67.26
ah ah said gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to	234.31
can be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad	465.25
this with my spanish affairs made pretty end to the	30.09
mine also are from him indeed sir recognize you you are captain	65.87
the cardinal interrupted mazarin was great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over	174.55
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at	22.92
it is he it must be he murmured	24.98
coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt	421.62
what are you doing here he asked in lofty tone as that of one accustomed to	81.87
him can place at your disposal it is count de	74.90
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set	45.92
milady was wrong in fearing that	27.48
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all	65.89

too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal	23.29
would realize how would you realize would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase farm then with my six months would	168.50
had fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from	88.95
yet he considered you the cause of his father dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my	75.90
that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live single	173.05
well then listen valentine said the count have favor to ask of	20.65
the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la	87.68
but excessive grief is like storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the	174.75
ah my lord if mistake not the chevalier artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for fear that this man is entirely devoted to the	96.36
before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what read in your eyes the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by	176.44
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la	43.63

de tréville attended the king gaming	239.70
we will divide our regiments into two	375.26
and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at	22.68
but this was not so easy matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of	326.00
de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest	339.54
the cardinal there awaited louis	12.70
this is what was	34.86
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in	272.05
we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our	24.33

you are most kind but as regards myself can find no merit possess save that as millionaire might have become partner in the speculations	296.91
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat oh this is what feared said	190.29
oh heavens cried	16.23

he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the	66.31
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other	67.62
what should care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and felt certain that no one could deprive me of her but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage do not think that is the	291.51
you love me you cried	11.87
once outside the city artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering little	84.98
ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into passion at random at noisy take care for warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long rip him	202.50
few moments passed great noise was heard at the	56.88
caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly	38.28
but hold out your	86.40
most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of	69.34
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to	91.56
you see am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should	235.02
franz paused for	111.84
artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity came to paris with exactly such	41.92
you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but should not have recollected it if you had not reminded	51.91
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said artagnan directing the sick man attention to the full stewpans and the empty	213.60
however to teresa great astonishment luigi remained mute and not word escaped his lips the rest of the	152.69
faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me	449.71
ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could	70.07
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert mask fell	702.68
of what importance is this little reptile to you asked	52.73
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only political	244.08
de villefort house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our	479.41
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the	68.40
come my lord you shall be treated like prince as you	28.34
aramis and his thesis artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator	43.11
he called out to the postilions at every	177.93
artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us	118.35
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from wish like submissive and devoted daughter slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice	493.82
bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground	80.40
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of	192.76
but why should it do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and much fear she envies me the fortune enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death	531.70
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of marble	165.17
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort faithful servant of the king does not know	63.05
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and	71.94
it was pledge	1459.24
will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with serene and glowing	306.01
then with friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like serpent through the opening and	416.14
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible that ever	158.60
why should you not be there because you have not yet invited	26.44
they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was	149.57
my safety is now mere question of	238.89
for what reason the same as	23.75
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people can they have received any news my lord not from england	154.53
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for	89.69
again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more	190.60
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice week the prisoners were deprived of	194.62
and now my lord that see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal	66.28
ho your honor cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting	55.54
signed abbé	17.86
rue du helder	168.27
don want any supper said	48.35
have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed doubt if it will	113.06
it is useless for swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you athos in the rue ferou and you aramis in the rue de	59.94
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the	77.16
on my word think you are right lucien said albert	56.14
and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to	33.58
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers	118.25
every criminal condemn seems to me living evidence that am not hideous exception to the	284.07
de busigny so let us fix the	197.13
but what can be the matter your note of this morning has completely bewildered	48.19
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de	42.14
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in	291.09
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly	183.46
artagnan am your prisoner treat me as	62.11
you will find them both here and can make your farewells in	194.35
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me	151.12
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing	798.73
at the end of hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the	52.22
expected thee said the bandit to rita	24.79
what do you mean speak you kill	14.68
oh how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at	125.67
the day before yesterday was fish day and they had nothing but	52.07
will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your	187.80
the notary	1247.01
why is it not done already what would you the cardinal has weakness for these men which cannot	55.89
he is bad priest said porthos who has pity for	80.15
by whom is it commanded by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the	546.38
and set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented little leather bag plump and giving out golden	213.47
well sir resumed danglars brief silence will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because did not know how much money might	331.04
julie threw herself into the arms of the count emmanuel embraced him as guardian angel morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his	81.01
do you think of him yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next monsieur de condé comes the duke of	283.37
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with	152.55
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides may not be there	168.82
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint méran	61.11
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of	971.98
and remember my life depends on your	94.27
the carriage in which broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand	33.01
excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence	122.66
athos smiled and opened the	37.81
the château if	26.79
the pont du gard inn	31.89
only seventeen months replied	53.09
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was	306.60
they sat silent and	142.00
let us return to my ring or rather to	44.17
they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like distant light wandering in the	343.72
it is the count	58.61
at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding spy glass in his	90.61
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he	128.85
splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the	544.96
the register of my child birth the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son is not his name andrea believe so said the	44.94
but what do you advise then asked mazarin	117.20
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the walls and re enter by the porta san giovanni these are my words	150.16
in each of these closets were placed masquerade	310.00
or of wisdom my dear baron or of wisdom said louis	44.89
here am said	13.53
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the	184.24
name only the most	90.39
ah she has carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted porthos one of whose faults was great looseness of	137.51
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on	73.62
then turning toward planchet he made him sign to uncock his	166.65
in what way why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and will show it to	86.93
what this one too he	46.40
still he had not even uttered	54.63
happily vanquished	16056.64
inspector continued the governor can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five	55.44
directly afterwards the moon	76.10
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his	38.19
how do you mean said valentine looking anxiously	57.13
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which was sleeping and on opening my eyes saw hers filled with	142.68
well my friend bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you	84.38
you say	165.53
the count took out small quantity of this with gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing long steadfast glance upon	186.40
artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized	30.59
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on	105.54
cavalcanti ah said he we have at pisa ugolino tower at ferrara tasso prison at rimini the room of francesca and	837.58
look at the comte de la fere type of nobility flower of	110.47
reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not it was la carconte that was proved at the trial since was only condemned to the	102.88
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by	195.82
let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you	69.16
who are they replied the	23.66
we have something very important to say to	19.78
it was seven clock in the morning and daylight began to	33.59
what is it cried many persons	66.05
it is color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among	1365.35
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz	110.58
foresee in it the aid of powerful	39.24
ten times as told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man debts and buried him decently and so edmond father died as he had lived without doing harm to	192.27
but before you leave france my dear father hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my	89.86
de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive one spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best	289.88
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of	121.16
in fact they touched the	75.62
you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars hope you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it	152.14
louise slid through the half open gate like snake and bounded lightly	225.35
be it	29.72
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran	34.83
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their	412.91
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed	55.30
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing fish similar to those on the	186.08
the great are often	50.23
de boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to high office in the police and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full	228.97
the proofs said benedetto laughing do you want proofs	28.85
who wants me man who will not tell his name but who comes from the	75.00
and madame de villefort cried	102.03
giving the sailor piece of money in return for his civility dantès proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to	270.80
apropos if you fire and you will do so for you are recommended to young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first	260.62
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet	29.49
alas monsieur said she that is too	37.83
good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl heart was filled with	132.41
there he had chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for	199.39
will be with you	123.11
you formerly lived believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor	58.02
franz took it with nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came	57.48
valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of	413.26
and in that case how shall know where you are you do not want your lackey is he sure man to the	65.75
and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in tremulous	58.60
you are woman of precaution see my dear madame coquenard said porthos squeezing the hand of the procurator wife	93.88
they stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their	146.89
yes sire said aramis yes you are	35.79
but go on	94.51
know he cannot save my life but he may strengthen me to give my	132.85
but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château	25.90
the man looked at the bank notes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink glass of water but he had no time to reach the water jug and fainted in the midst of his dried	155.64
yes share your hopes the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and am	76.25
as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus	219.45
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young	20.87
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated	307.23
exactly and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in	178.61
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging	291.72
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de	49.64
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at	62.04
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too	83.06
yes my lord	2974.50
why on board the tartan replied the	39.63
oh saved saved cried	11.20
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his	265.21
hush porthos remained silent and	16.32
the pope therefore blesses with the	202.20
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement	153.89
in that earnest look might be read deep reproach as well as terrible	195.72
proceed said he to the	56.60
the foundation ein or federal tax identification number	26.72
penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he	498.50
one went to support artagnan the other	22.31
he hastened to open the and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of	60.15
oh you are just man cried milady throwing herself at his	115.85
the count withdrew for	19.29
five full casks and fifty empty	116.88
you have truly monsieur said artagnan bowing again courtesy for which assure you am very	104.09
the deuce that puts different face on the	72.58
parry who accompanied him stood behind	12.27
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing	98.23
it is singular said the doctor was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such	57.55
fancied myself despised	90.22
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	78.06
what of that come with us said	33.14
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès she pressed her son hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved	141.18
and he drank off half bottle at draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and	182.54
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than	68.58
but they believe am shut up alone	40.73
what are we to say to this asked	20.87
true said aramis but silence the president is speaking to the	18.39
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to	66.92
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in	326.27
it is really wonderful said the count above all if as suppose it is payable at	68.90
count you render me sadder than before if it be	95.51
nevertheless carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings	285.87
it was morrel turn to become	31.09
as to artagnan being at bottom prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them breakfast of	203.58
one moment said the prisoner in	36.31
no certainly	42.96
most undoubtedly said	390.64
oh do not kill me cried the	74.93
there is said he at the end of his meditations clever maxim which bears upon what was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in naturally depraved mind human nature in right and wholesome state revolts at	358.51
she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the	69.25
sir said the servant have favour to ask	50.93
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had	299.02
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the	251.80
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please want capital to build my plans	180.11
by heavens exclaimed monte cristo starting back it is ali raised his	81.13
monseigneur will be with him in an	52.95
the two men in black bowed in their	14.74
the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated	135.58
what is it said monte	7.35
fernand mind was made up he would shoot dantès and then kill	79.28
you can think how have missed him the great	87.34
athos counseled artagnan to dismiss the fellow porthos was of the opinion that he should give him good thrashing first and aramis contended that master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to	283.75
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself yes	115.06
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but owe this money to the charity fund deposit which promised to pay this	179.02
tis well resumed the	31.08
it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future then in case of my refusal this valor should struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most	387.90
if the king was still irritated against them they would depart without being seen if the king consented to see them they would only have to be	95.29
yes said aramis athos is right in	73.15
wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered	27.44
to whom nobody	169.03
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the	328.87
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in	203.66
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely short carbine and pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with single barrelled	296.35
caderousse had once more parted with his treasure the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the	97.70
no human being not even my sister is aware of its	79.63
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping	52.16
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstool now let us talk about our own	189.65
and how do you know there is young woman whom love and that believed that woman dead asked	76.21
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say am the angel of the lord and the other am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be	384.42
when look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when look at that chair before which now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that am not very guilty woman and you menacing	493.65
then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing	283.03

during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he	565.03

athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his	55.67
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this	240.06
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by sound sleep and good	491.91

haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo voice had awakened her from dream and she resumed her	154.58

hush returned	663.58
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his	157.37

to say that shall live here like the mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe	236.66
the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking	200.46
my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the	56.02
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but single sound giving but single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the	79.00
the answer pleased him and he	33.10
hullo said albert it is monte cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and	40.78
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such thing as change in our original	125.23
well in that case we can manage famously said artagnan which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you that which was given to me	95.53
come sweep away all that for me shoulder muskets present arms aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that artagnan could not repress burst of homeric	381.72
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he adjure you as christian and soldier to tell me where we are	257.44
the husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible	359.28
tis that	4293.95
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be	44.13
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was	74.54
de tréville and how the devil did you escape by miracle monsieur must acknowledge with sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like butterfly on	176.88
artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his	65.92
let us see if she shuts the door him he	152.61
chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of gallery on the ground	103.02
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be	212.83
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the	954.39
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given	87.82
and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship owners would have his preference	317.87
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns year he is therefore great	142.75
at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped pace forward and slight tinge of red colored his pale	267.25
monsieur the duke	40.27
very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more will give them to you will not even ask who they are do as you like with	103.73
ah so much the better but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room ah sir must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet	123.51
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the	501.02
noirtier for whom france was vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was	755.02
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by	125.40
he descended fifteen steps and the door of dungeon was opened and he was thrust	30.51
but then you yourself are known to others yes am known so that proceed my dear monsieur	78.35
well then resumed faria with bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that am the poor mad prisoner of the château if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and	421.97
why good god you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and pessimist when men were in	148.25
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of	63.26
yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort elbeuf and de bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take charenton such are my	209.55
he was not ignorant that such beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all	130.18
rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad the other	50.69
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between swiss and	44.68
yes replied the man but at what price listen friend said monte	62.93
sacrebleu artagnan said porthos must out with it at once for can keep to myself anything have against you haven been able to recognize you in this	120.33
he kept himself upright and dreamed without	198.66
wish you may my lord replied de	20.16
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his	39.16
porthos bowed as if in	55.70
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and come back still more weary and low spirited that	252.03
franz de quesnel baron	335.87
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his	71.16
he has at the request of your father opened an account of francs month	42.75
aramis reflected for minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you service artagnan shall be grateful to you all my	119.08
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second	73.90
my lord said athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship service and his most faithful	135.47
raoul gives me much uneasiness he	23.61
bazin my friend come	62.82
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the	63.66
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the	319.08
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and wave passed over his head which drowned his	118.46
artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	152.85
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too	216.34
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was remnant of his ancient marauding character	368.59
there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past am fifty and am obliged to recollect	194.14
without your aid continued he repeating the count words should have been dead man thrice	114.86
know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and will take upon myself the making of your	45.19
then let us pray to heaven said the	69.56
and the cargo inquired the owner	17.36
will you be ambassador albert will send you to	59.30
they all mounted the horses as quickly as	11.05
aramis searching look seemed to seek his friend thought even at the bottom of his heart but artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable	103.63
do you dance count dance yes you it would not be	53.50
thought perhaps that the king death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be	79.69
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the	72.42
what do you again defy me no the fact is have found my	37.56
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king gaming	148.93
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to	86.20
you do not understand asked	40.22
the apartment	28.05
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand repeat his words just as he uttered	89.28
albert came up to them at this moment with	30.45
the history to	68.89
now said morrel do you wish me to retire	21.86
there came in moreover two drafts	228.54
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless	206.77
will go immediately and inform him of your	56.39
never that is long time but it is something that you believe	25.52
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel	56.92
your mother will add to them recipe for certain balsam which she had from bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the	387.88
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the	330.84
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late artagnan had already recognized	124.94
my dear mother said he do you know	26.03
at every stroke jet of blood sprang from the	146.70
ay ay said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in	160.98
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about	132.03
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of	132.88
the château if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme	23.99
said the origin of his fortune remained	95.20
although in reality liberal he negotiated loan of six millions for	523.77
it is only shown to me to terrify me that	64.45
well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be	87.27
is mazarin dead asked	50.73
ah my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal ah he was great	130.09
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet	65.81
it was from	35.34
de boville he was in such state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the	137.28
aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and	26.89
oh father do not look in that way at me oh am guilty then you will not pardon me the monk recovered his usual	80.09
that is well but where and how shall see you again do you wish to see me again	60.82
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber	64.33
true but am not	156.19
planchet said artagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half dozen bottles of beaugency wine prefer	438.16
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into spanish	100.83
ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are	77.41
instead of going direct to his	104.05
aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted	52.94
the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the	19.44
we dress the king in groslow	35.22
only ask you simple question answer it that is all	49.61
artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that	39.47
you talk of sacrilege why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each	132.00
this door was guarded by sentinel and there was also guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti	89.86
yes inherited this little property when quitted the army as told	76.90
still said château renaud	134.47
one has never the last word with such	15.63
at that moment hand touched his	13.34
besides said artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as am remind you of prudence besides believe we are not here in very proper place for imparting	210.21
were you pleased with paris sir yes but you are much in want of revolution like our own not against your king who is mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queen	181.29
his things and his bag are with him has he taken off his doublet on the contrary everything is in the	50.86
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could	47.01
the prisoner first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of	294.65
bertuccio said the count unless am mistaken it has been already	30.89
know it monsieur replied villefort and am now going to examine	36.83
will go said the	31.14
without him should probably at this moment be dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was question of nothing less than throwing me into the	148.97
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than visit to the room they were about to	123.31
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered	852.47
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the	133.23
the one have hired for	69.32
artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the	33.14
but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte	21.02
let us go then said	13.91
there remains the valise added	60.02
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same	112.75
morrel shall have his	133.67
it was thus with	150.13
there may be an ambuscade concealed in this	76.03
you said sir you would like to help me but yes but added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not	133.01
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir don know believe me take my oath pane of glass out continued the count dark lantern bunch of false keys secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of	551.46
the duchess remained moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she	406.33
make about twelve thousand francs year without counting little benefice of thousand crowns the prince gave	163.39
ah maximilian experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me will never leave	114.73
did say dead or alive replied	86.92
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare supper when they had in their boat bread wine half dozen partridges and good fire to roast them	316.82
what is that did you observe artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton no but if it occurs fourth time shall complain of it so never	302.88
he will be here	46.07
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome	118.52
oh my god cried she my god are you going to drown me these cries had something so heartrending in them	202.38
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his	105.36
forgot to mention to you said the count that lay yearly aside certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom am compelled to dismiss lose as matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my	452.51
one of them was called the chevalier	12.89
third rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo make three assortments in fortune first rate second rate and third rate	283.31
de motteville will not be astonished at this	109.11
they continued their inquiries and at last met with light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted artagnan to	146.24
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the	158.49
cavalcanti to	633.20
fire first oh obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us	203.83
now that you are no longer beside me am afraid every moment of	99.42
told him very humbly for could not conceal from myself the scrape had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty musketeers told him was quite ready to submit to his	283.93
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his	717.40
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the	100.51
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine	86.89
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me fearful	121.73
mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied	41.36
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than	34.15
and have you placed the letter before him as ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he	57.09
thou seest simpleton said artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to	240.66
he has done us the honor to remain	13.74
ah what next most	37.60
danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted	321.71
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to	169.41
be of good cheer replied dantès your strength will	97.31
artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen	163.98
groslow began turning the cards one	35.93
what for asked	444.73
the three friends burst into	10.66
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with	68.48
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing	27.47
shall rely on	39.13
this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de condé and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was	292.97
and very soon they left the	89.16
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests	360.24
it was past question now that faria was not lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer	244.42
take care of the executioner	88.72
let us go	147.30
let us strive beseech you let us strive to be	95.53
and what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same	32.70
on the contrary do not look at him but at	11.50
ah true you drive don carlos out of	137.22
being naturally goodhearted and having had once liking for athos which had grown into sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of	500.41
do not lie my angel said artagnan smiling that would be	97.39
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses	64.48
ah it was this gentleman said artagnan bowing to the	63.74
and you complain of that said	19.57
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on pleasant face responded in stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is	656.75
it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if part of her past life had returned to	51.88
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered	110.16
moment later the gray headed man was beside	101.17
my fault said he you must be mad what do know of the grecian affair have travelled in that country did advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence said albert with thundering	234.58
when he had gained the angle of the street he	17.75
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to	38.77
and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at	78.19
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here so much the	86.60
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate	105.37
my lord said artagnan why should because you shrug your	81.19
then my friends and took her tried her and condemned	28.34
at the close of the act he therefore went to the	18.28
of the second opening	100.25
sir said planchet when he saw artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you in case of necessity might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the	125.12
de villefort said the king come	11.00
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckingham in short that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the	160.41
the blade was round and of flexible	68.62
renée regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent	493.61
this did not take	49.94
he recovered little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all	250.93
might have suspected he was poisoning	476.50
this time small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the	108.14
no replied athos fortunately monsieur artagnan has only	184.89
at last avrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive still cried villefort oh doctor what dreadful word is	156.80
you think so	33.58
aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of finely organized	401.52
am brave when set about	19.81
well the man whom offer you is general	314.47
still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant	189.56
am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may	169.56
am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against	32.39
but artagnan stopped his hand and in hoarse voice cried wait athos	61.65
hello here is my watch let me see what time it	18.93
speak to me not as magistrate but as friend and when am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that ought to be	137.42
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	191.94
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of	104.19
very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian cannot exactly say but this know that he is noble as borghese and rich as gold	328.93
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell tent artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at	90.27
he was nobleman man equal to buckingham in every	120.79
have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of	126.43
besides which in short time resumed artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great	277.96
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of	66.88
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without	110.15
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury do then as did my	41.23
if you wish	72.46
maximilian my dearest brother she	121.09
you think he has am sure of it said athos don you see that raoul is in love indeed with whom with child seven years old dear friend at raoul age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or	243.10
for some temperaments work is remedy for all	154.87
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other	163.59
what do you say sire god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that have always taken her part warmly even against	202.55
yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure do not know	38.43
beauchamp pulled out his	53.32
you are very lucky if you see anything such night as this said	53.08
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said	88.66
see here exclaimed	42.18
morrel asked	1462.74
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to	36.20
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his	69.71
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with	136.24
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de	148.60
the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his	112.07
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is	47.57
the child put the piece of money into his	18.19
madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from friend am indeed most wretched replied	118.68
they are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the	198.98
very well let us	13.06
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst go to prepare my lord for his	301.40
and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows correspondent at yanina informs us of fact of which until now we had remained in	165.16
what that grimaud shall wait on us at	41.04
do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us pray	80.80
well asked the two	553.92
my lord let us come to terms ask nothing	38.10
won have dantès killed won and who has said word about killing him muddlehead replied	219.52
the four young men waited ten minutes quarter of an hour twenty minutes and seeing	75.28
artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward athos upon horse he owed to woman aramis on horse he owed to his mistress porthos on horse he owed to his procurator wife and artagnan on horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress	124.67
athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read	150.86
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with artagnan when he was on	69.66
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that	32.13
the moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly	202.47
ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair	45.44

did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before	16.69
ah now think of it the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the hall said	29.33
all this doubt only gave rise to more lively desire of arriving at certainty and he went into his friend chamber with fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of	327.39
athos who heard milady voice came sharply	154.59

in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his	371.34
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his	50.14
then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as	41.65

then artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows artagnan was not millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far	165.40
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous	259.61

ah ah but what going on in the city yonder said	24.19
artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her	35.94

quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain	217.86

cavalcanti looked at danglars with stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young	69.71
violent convulsion attacked the old	177.42

in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative	141.46
behind artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red	28.99
then morrel came out from his hiding place with beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be	136.19
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned	28.67
the cardinal knocked three times and in peculiar	30.77
what the devil paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific	513.25

adieu abbé said the coadjutor am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this	146.69
at the end of half an hour or thereabouts clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to	173.87
short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk	329.91
let us sit	11.71
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for made them by serving your	114.63
did you send this wine aramis said	22.34
bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity	183.26
tried to pray but my tongue was	84.96
well who am bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that will kill	62.18
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy	46.64
ah said morrel one quits dungeon in week month or	95.16
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against	159.04
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not	74.62
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such	80.23

you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing	671.90
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no	24.92
artagnan was woman and still more	25.27
the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost	230.42

de saint méran whose sole heiress	210.36
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and	188.79
few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with	125.30

by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle quarter of league distant dantès saw fishing boat driven rapidly like spectre before the power of winds and	307.53

there could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be delicate attention to be gratefully received artagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him crown piece to drink to general cromwell	200.42
the district doctor approached with the indifference of man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the	188.48

madame danglars rose from her seat pale and	33.56
everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was	42.33
valentine said he dear valentine you must not speak thus rather let me	80.75

de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen emissary to the exiled duchess musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis	414.46

edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flag stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of subterraneous	311.02

the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel	181.34
the count then placed his foot on his head saying know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull	243.51

but alas if he was the friend of artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young	143.09

beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of	354.78

madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to scene of scandalous	237.47

still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so	127.22
the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his	365.39

the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of	81.93

de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse	178.16
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to	192.64
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure	373.94
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell third	34.88
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the	113.32
artagnan thought of all these	53.48

now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as am in this pilot coat on night as dark as	122.14
ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass	137.12
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with feeling of self	41.46
for twenty years have tasted nothing but	180.34
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	24.56
however scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe	147.53
in moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her son	38.11
athos made step toward	52.82
will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at all not at all replied artagnan let no one	60.09
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor	34.18
yes but could give him the order guitant and preferred to give it to	25.44
the host proved to be worthy man as bald as	79.52

the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in manner truly	107.43
in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his	63.34
they expected to hear some mention made of artagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and	168.33
see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my	60.05
sir replied artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young shall therefore overlook your frivolous	316.06
outwardly and in the eyes of the world am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the	86.19

you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating	87.14
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling cap and calling his valet checked with look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first	519.27
precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that painter could never represent or physiologist	300.14
by circumstances no by	30.51
that is agreed	55.18
even under this disguise asked mazarin raising cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with	305.65
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to	163.29

this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned	59.75
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said château	141.79
you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of	38.37
the man was wrapped up in large	8.32
well you must become diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is	154.49

as for artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting	95.17
the other in the rue de la harpe	21.43

he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurator wife had proved so refractory with respect to her	257.63
it took some time for artagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely	126.85
have already told you it is fancy you have taken in your	28.48

aramis look at that horse oh the frightful brute said	65.09
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to	288.51
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of	59.71
monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	98.38
if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful	129.86
who has told me this fine story monsieur who should it be but he who watches while sleep who labors while amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroad in france as in europe your majesty probably refers to god	453.45

ah said the count in somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural	331.16
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by	105.36
avrigny in god name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid	151.84
faith yes it is so long ago answered	39.67

but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall ever meet her again friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this	154.48
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir say my highness is furious to such degree assure you though would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only look but smile and had they not known it for fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been	493.54

it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of gendarme appear at one of these	388.97

you have not returned that visit and you were	73.55

this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this	504.60
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the	26.81
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find certain difficulty in circumventing	212.72
then artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of nature to reassure the most	321.59
held back his	77.48
will you examine	41.92
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at little boat made fast to pile and ready rigged as if waiting to	201.93
these poor creatures had no bad	142.63
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against	110.09

you must know felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in pink satin jacket and cap that could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style actually clapped my hands with	570.43
and asked mazarin moment	255.58

well observed franz this chief is very polite and see no objection the more so as bring my share of the	194.62
the president paused and the count turned	20.66

what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in low tone to	32.28

morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that	38.93
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven we are the poor succored by	187.81
athos fancied he had seen him among the	23.76

the departure for belgium few minutes the scene of confusion produced in the salons	62.47
very well my worthy gentleman replied artagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this	91.33
my father had long white beard but loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths	146.68
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to	118.09
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal	180.67
but know you my lad said athos appearing on the	66.56
no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you yes do remember replied the	80.14
ah said the marquise de saint méran woman with stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the	884.49
at that moment the door	8.81
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back	32.63
but to return to what we were	16.84
bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and half have given him and that shall find carriage of some sort ready at the	84.62
porthos wanted to follow	16.13
apropos said artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably	103.95
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming follow	46.82
but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty	75.57
ah ah said	8.80
now we have in dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of party in italy who has been here since and in he went mad and the change is	305.83

so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that	455.99

appeared walking	7976.66
well at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in that of not being able to call day my own not even that of my	154.56
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn did not perceive that there were three of	164.33
what matters it about broussel it is name not	57.22
the most satisfactory part of the matter said artagnan is that there remains no trace of	41.23
what the accusation no the	10.82
well be it so let us not dispute about words and	40.66
whom do you suspect come answer	170.70
listen cried he pity me help me no my daughter is not	37.06
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married	41.28
the letter is	38.80
and supposing you had succeeded should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near here the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulen and then should have been	117.40
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then said morcerf turning pale with	88.14
can only say how sincerely ask pardon for having grieved	153.52
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from	109.68
will place it on her table myself tonight he	73.76
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty	276.16
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window don open the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	130.14
what is his name did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although thought from his accent he was an	118.20
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to	37.63
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books	151.26
come in cried	41.80
foreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini and if gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except tax or two now and	443.57
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did tear fall from his eyes it was	245.49
pshaw said monte cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and	62.04
fancied continually that saw the figure of the corsican between the	50.22
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear duke you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are	365.25

but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could	270.23
you too then are unhappy she	26.59
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte	57.72
the queen advanced few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully	397.85
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from	170.51
at this moment little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce	434.03
besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than	49.15
so far as can judge suppose this to be quarter of my father	105.19
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us	129.90
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than	33.12
morrel attributed penelon embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the	375.73
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by	11.76
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice week for as had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great	121.33

here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for now recollect	40.75
you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary request	16.48
the blade was red for the blood had become rust momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary	174.56
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read of the report of meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february	59.14
supper was	18725.04
the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is devoted submissive and irreproachable	83.14

yes you are right should be ashamed for anyone to know your	123.82
the count of monte cristo is always an early riser and can answer for his having been up these two	83.75
if you succeed with him pronounce you the demon	54.86
de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the	31.25
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master wishes and had already gone to fetch	84.45
well feel as if transformed confession weighs on my	210.74
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the	124.44
we know that said	69.12
edmond found some solace in these	211.30
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis that all can	85.10
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at cabaret on the high road man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink glass of wine and darted searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were	224.76
may not drink to your health and you to mine said artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality	138.89
at nine clock then be ready here at the hôtel will come and take	36.03
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of dozen men holding lantern in his	50.46
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini rear when he	165.86
ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of grief declared long suppression ah have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and have preserved lives in exchange for that took	615.94

valentine cast down her eyes this was good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming	104.30
smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the	84.14
yes if am killed said albert	48.50
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like thunderbolt and she fell	233.73
henry said charles call me your	32.76
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of	228.28
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or	151.33
on his part the king returned to his	18.15

come said athos here another good	56.72
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized	90.10
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then long sigh of disappointment the head	141.15
come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not	35.37
god grant you as much let us	54.52
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur	43.54
but where shall we go asked	16.38
it is bad news yes	98.62

notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers artagnan felt completely	93.58
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking	103.70
yes replied morcerf he said something about it to	24.06
well why should not we too belong to party you had your secret and we had ours we didn exchange	213.41
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two	75.56

some ham my boy or we can	2600.06
he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if begin by speaking of myself but must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the	214.06

demand admittance said loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and	261.54
the pope awaited	13.37
the cardinal was speaking to him in low voice and the king was very	18.11
then let us draw on the	55.66
épinay for he came this morning to	83.41
ah yes about year the disappearance of his son the poor old man	82.92
franz felt shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal	123.74
you are here said	25.00
how gardener may get rid of the dormice	220.64
franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with	88.99
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church	27.51
in corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from	130.26
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years	186.86
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who	32.64
good lord how cold am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to house set out with all the attributes of suburban tavern and knocked at the	200.87
in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascon hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave terrible trace in it and athos bowed to artagnan like man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his	297.17
yes but in my soul much more than in my	25.97
with such mecum_ artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his	664.38
permit me madame said artagnan to reserve portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done	174.99
while yet young unfortunately handsome was dragged into	154.96
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in	129.90
we must then as it appears to me travel in	32.66
see that you require someone to answer for me admit that would reassure me	114.15
artagnan friends reminded him that he had visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to	75.77
the next	43.88
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived large white	77.82
persons whom do not like yes	79.69
jesus dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is knight of malta as timid as young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket	330.54
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the	146.38
they then set off for	181.58
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	121.94
it was the portrait of young woman of five or six and twenty with dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long	133.80
ah cried albert it is very lucky	27.22

this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter	467.40
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but cannot suffer poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your	296.97

the minister bowed his head and while deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph	118.06
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying knew it guessed it but too late by minute unfortunate unfortunate that am felton made no	396.67

my wife escaped cried	45.77
why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any	46.74
artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen	80.93
now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and	99.38
noirtier and the elder épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his	247.05
there is here no question of crime or	46.86

like all other things of this world having had beginning had an end and this end our four companions began to be somewhat	147.39
be satisfied said the procurator	11.92
the owner did not wait for second	42.73
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	115.37
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words man lying on coil of cables rose and advanced few steps toward	212.84

morrel good worthy man said	12.11
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was	50.51

albert was on the point of pronouncing his father name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was	157.43
yes returned dantès holding out his hand thank you	49.99
but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see	103.91
now my fault is	117.92
and that he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated	120.09
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through	126.12
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès	29.72
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to	28.70
lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon couch on the other side of the	242.84

athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with	621.65
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had	307.50
but monte cristo is not the only one miss here do not see	64.23
the eyes of the paralytic expressed multitude of tumultuous	70.98
yet must know his	122.63

the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own	62.89
it was then that he saw horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at little	75.00

why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored	238.00
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie	191.48
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to height of six	272.33
they then determined to	253.53

the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his	25.27
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson	107.31
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	127.84
who brought it into this room then mademoiselle	35.94
and who have answered for him to the queen who have promised my poor mistress ah my god my god she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies ah monsieur bonacieux never did love you much but now it is worse than	175.60

these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the	63.84
the only thing that astonished artagnan was that his friends had never thought of	28.46
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with messenger whom he did not wish to see at	311.04
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of gascon barely failed to	359.18
yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that	44.29
that does not concern	16.14

monsieur has returned then of course naively replied the	127.73
then why do you apply to me that may be sure have the right	35.65
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and	157.90
but there are no more said	15.33
what you start for paris you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to	53.45
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the	16.99
it was long time before was able to make out what place was in or to take account of the details	55.00
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry union with any other would have caused him the same	90.90
milady uttered frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her	165.14
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive	54.75
they went to rueil cried	25.72
that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us	29.95
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de	211.32
father and son	199.46
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and	176.56
can trust in you oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul am ready to die for your majesty this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking	142.20
he wore	132.14
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita	50.02
charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest	343.02
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by	41.35

neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the	198.06
well observed the englishman as if he were slow of	46.34

gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter can my lord said	159.14
but you is there nothing that you want we came here with the intention of asking for something to	55.71
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on	140.64
eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator wife as bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister	337.66
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another	238.31
go make out my bill and notify my	130.19
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly	194.68
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me	71.56
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the	191.10
pardon monsieur pity in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his	120.88
these last words were uttered in so low tone that the stranger could not hear	27.53
am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable	127.95
sire it is something more opaque than the	188.04
and said athos am returning to	55.24
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed	45.60
while the rest slept then we went away short distance we severed our fetters with file the englishman had given us and swam	290.97
perhaps not replied danglars but hear that he is ambitious and that rather against	49.20
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos for madame may say was your victim when wounded dying was abandoned by the	175.59
the clock struck nine as the door opened and coachman	40.70
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and	123.60
impossible and executed in our	52.03

great god said	51.88
now four days had elapsed and valentine still	39.76
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy	77.31
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the	227.85
then an idea came to him which harmonized	155.40
conditions why not because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors	146.49
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards luckily found small opening which afforded me view of the apartment and what was passing	222.22
go my dear curate and may god assist you and you sir continued gondy turning to the curate of	47.39
count he said swear to you my soul is no longer my	28.38
this and some dried fruits and flask of monte pulciano was the bill of	145.15
well did there not happen an event which saved austria why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie precisely said the	256.55
the stables are on either side of the gate which you see	52.95
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de	98.30
they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by fiery	134.67
ah that is different the house you purchase is at	16.85
deeply engaged with sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for moment to join in the	181.45
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be	133.40
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy may go where	129.19
and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left my dear porthos you are really man of most superior understanding said artagnan with look as if he spoke against his	189.99
de morcerf he whom wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom announced your promised visit and may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in	228.28
no what say replied bonacieux is only that may know whether am delaying	82.05
around this kind of rolling tent pressed crowd of gentlemen and	70.43
it will be useless for him to find you	38.45
de morcerf will accompany	23.05
don be afraid said	29.13
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like train of lighted gunpowder along the	343.12
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	39.46
about this time the nurse cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with cup in her	73.77
and also said	22.56
it is very fortunate said artagnan to	39.52
in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like	97.63
you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before	188.67
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the	319.83
yes was the reply in low	9.51
how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight duel with pistols all the instructions had given	181.25
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful	264.07
monsieur returned villefort was then royalist because believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the	59.10
thanks danglars that will smooth over all	101.39
franz astonished advanced	172.57
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere	221.84
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at	110.15
seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon artagnan but he had too strong an	42.91
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator	143.01
his mother he	1410.01
will suppose anything you	104.92
this that another	119.18
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection never to	861.49
the queen made curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under	137.93
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went	222.64
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making step toward the	50.85
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond	677.04
with the count of morcerf answered monte	7.90
where in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her	26.79
so preferring death to capture accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined	501.32
oh my dear viscount do talk reason do not desire to do	44.31
at seven clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding	101.95
artagnan bent down to his horse neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the	63.57
here you decide then nothing about me my lord on the contrary have come to	42.62
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such man as richelieu to act as we pleased what is such or such prince to us who fixed the diadem upon great queen head artagnan ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for	341.31
yes my	281.63
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious	230.12
mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged terrible look at artagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced human	231.14
but give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword will make great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on	446.17
pen ink and paper muttered	58.53
and the queen what queen madame henrietta of england daughter of henry	46.03
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found vast concourse of	115.92
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known	143.37
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his	183.12
mercédès seized fernand hands with transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last friend long hours of solitary	159.72
now sir said artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same	58.42
the yard was empty the clock was striking	17.12
general épinay died five minutes	361.54
it was agreed in brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as	221.08
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender	67.69
she had son observed	38.08
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion strongly marked nose and black and well shaped	151.67
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten	90.92
those who would as it were force passage to his heart found an impassable	155.12
mercy said caderousse crossing	61.85
you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered	119.58
replied artagnan for my part am eating veal garnished with shrimps and	591.05
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and shall know what have to	115.49
ah ah	5604.71
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the	120.67
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single	179.04
each of them took one which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the	117.13
at last traveling two days and night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent	140.65
no your excellency returned bertuccio it was vendetta followed by	214.17
ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful	222.49
ah yes said château	6.44
begin and without any	117.34
maximilian morrel said the servant announcing two fresh	95.40
what monseigneur said artagnan with calmness which astonished the cardinal	52.04
the emperor now king of the petty island of elba having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects small population of five or six thousand souls having been accustomed to hear the napoléons_ of hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her	638.94
to kill the turnkey yes the very one who is lighting	57.75
then it is settled said the count and give you my solemn assurance that only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that have long	105.65
parry said the king rising too my horse desire to go to	44.53
gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of boy twelve years	356.27
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by	25.61
the first carriage which arrived that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager	53.32
like benefactors in romances should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been virtue beyond my strength because am weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow	350.03
my mind was already made	33.90
who is speaking of monsieur artagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the	40.84
the officer	46.64
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of	100.55
they might be said to be procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white	111.46
be assured you will not find her majesty	49.23
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money this is no act of selfishness but of	65.48
de tréville promised this favor novitiate of two years novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant	443.05
albert tottered and fell overpowered in	399.30
well thought of porthos this time you have an	21.33
it piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much	107.32
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in living voice and she was about to utter an	91.65
de morcerf begging me to attend the	99.82
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why all he should not be beloved for himself he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the	358.61
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow	62.58
this time my determination is irrevocably	213.78
feel cramps over my whole	283.18
stand here don stir turn your back to the road and wait for	46.63
well having then keeper like la ramee should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my	159.07
close the door said la carconte do not like open doors when it	75.67
she cast glance at the door the baron had had plank nailed over the	78.55
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but glass of	212.11
this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty	490.17
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his	136.26
in the name of heaven my lord cried	14.18
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or	73.92
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former	256.24
bonacieux took	65.08
tall pale clerk his face shaded by forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good	451.66
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of	61.80
the order is	479.11
point one of the poniards at la ramee breast and say to him my friend am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art dead man the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the	228.36
ah he gone to blois the poor boy wherefore ah to inquire the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you	246.42
should like to know upon what occasion oh dieu that is very easily	124.12
but in what carriage do we start have provided for everything carriage below is waiting for your	60.48
and as am connoisseur in such things having had few of my own once estimated it at thousand	231.95
am lost said artagnan to	27.92
the queen is likely to follow mazarin counsels and to have me	46.95
you see then morrel that he was more unhappy lover than	28.88
only imagine what happiness that would afford	28.65
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin	70.70
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked	37.87
dust am and to dust	83.96
mazarin thought for an	75.21
and morcerf with forced smile arose and making low bow	53.11
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its	179.76
he has simply mahogany secretaire in which the key is always	71.09
then it is settled yes but where have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his	145.46
the middle one	29.24
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur artagnan there not man in france that esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so on his account add two hundred	206.61
do lose by that no you are on the contrary	32.57
as one confides letter to the hollow of tree to the wing of pigeon to the collar of	141.37
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days which he reappeared with pale face and thinner person but with money in his	150.17
artagnan of the king guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight	47.95
then cried planchet joyously see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we	81.48
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and	628.57
at least artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least shall not be alone in my	111.08
then should like to have three sons should make the first nobleman like athos the second good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like	108.86
most lovely creature upon my soul was his	114.48
planchet slept in the antechamber upon coverlet taken from the bed of artagnan and which artagnan from that time made shift to do	108.74
and la ramee was found locked up in the prisoner room gag in his mouth and poniard near	59.72
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than	256.32
beauchamp it is quite	509.14
that true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his	92.29
will run for it sir and the guide went	27.79
but he went on with his peculiar smile am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for	82.09
does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will	31.94
well that is all that wanted and will be guided by counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte	80.53
am all	690.71
by her husband who was nobleman of your acquaintance continued artagnan looking intently at	63.68
they are soldiers though resumed de	56.31
in the course of his morning walk he collected two or three small branches from tree and found small piece of broken glass discovery that quite delighted	284.84
which is to say that the gascons made king of me myself seeing that am my father son is it not tréville well happily don say nay to	119.43
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like	178.99
charles bowed and	72.50
gave the custom house officers copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent man off with the pilot to whom gave	101.07
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the	117.80
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another	253.33
alone he was alone again again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth was not faria fate the better all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like phantom over the abbé dead	410.26
that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome kind of lizard with vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the	351.90
this child has caused me to recover what had	67.66
the spadas remained in doubtful ease mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two	493.20
perhaps you speak the truth	13.32
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to	18.04
here one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses asked artagnan jumping on one of	99.44
today is the	186.31
now said gondy there is communion between	184.99
ah monsieur said artagnan as if to sum up in word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our	246.12
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in	152.36
oh yes they will only listen to that charming	66.88
but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	89.12
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his	113.01
well what do you propose to do she said at length come	58.51
the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and	29.38
next day hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the	71.06
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis	30.29
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at	80.04
two angelic	3.88
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his	105.59
look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his	133.98
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to	157.49
villefort continued he knows me and have pledged my word to	68.64
he first	10580.82
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their	177.68
arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone found this broken sword blade as was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded	294.02
you are mistaken viscount believe he has not franc in his	129.91
rex ponticus_ said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at	538.87
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man hope you have sword at home but at all events have two and if you like will throw with you for one of	119.09
good thought gondy she is going to	149.22
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into	118.30
it is misfortune and government owes nothing to his	54.46
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and which prevented him from so	119.78
that was the very evening when the abduction of	44.49
morrel said not	209.24
on your honor on my	10.24
minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the	138.95
de chevalier dessessart to admit artagnan as cadet in his company of	128.10
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it	115.99
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via	241.20
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on	53.15
he is man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and thick	156.67
things look black enough replied porthos understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible	151.62
the fact is look to my turn for keeping guard with	29.92
merri was	1719.24
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only right but	100.80
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in	45.01
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of	350.80
at that moment aramis	40.46
do not do so reverend	12.99
said artagnan can she have charged you to tell me so oh no monsieur but out of the regard have for you have taken the resolution to tell you	47.38
artagnan turned to look at his	99.28
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time artagnan was better informed than she	110.48
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over	24.23
they are all the same	29.99
another horse said	26.09
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled	162.52
no but franz has for heaven sake not word of this before	67.21
we will see gentlemen we will	10.48
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady	129.40
have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming	94.61
give up broussel she cried fine counsel	119.11
and what did you understand by what we said thousand	62.94
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in	170.12
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the	97.49

but what ails you you are	56.62
bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by artagnan and	51.31
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave start of surprise behind her	164.86
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the	50.27

the blow was sped by artagnan the rapier had pierced his	150.30
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me single instant so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your	91.75
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by	261.36
napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of	243.86
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency	54.05
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary pen and some paper and placed them all on table where there was	156.93
franz remained moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief	300.52
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do have both reflected and decided answered	359.14
this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the	113.76

cannot tell you that replied the inspector can only promise to examine into your	40.60
you told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser waited month or rather suffered for month did hope man is poor wretched creature did	156.92
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then	204.02
this crisis past endeavored to catch your eye but could	101.16
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two	33.62
what do you mean by the pure parliament are there then two parliaments my friend artagnan interrupted as don understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the	211.96
but could you not compromise matters and give up portion of your fortune to her son how could make such proposition especially to woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my	585.81
feel myself drawn toward you who have never loved anyone but my benefactor who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	161.47
when one puts on mask it is not difficult to wear beard under	121.15
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed	100.66
speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head crown which he stole from under pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me thank you	550.47
bravo thought artagnan on this side think the cardinal will be well	43.19
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered few remaining	162.25
now this was sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with	72.66
have already had the honor of telling you was said	17.46
what is that give ball you know how much the queen loves	44.12
artagnan glanced at the dinner	34.95
my only fear is that he will be too strong for	25.29
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him veritable	98.64
can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for	91.04
thanks gentlemen thanks as you see my health is but	75.91
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our	276.96
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was	85.99
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for	71.56
from their dress covered with dust and from certain easy manner by means of which man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of few	262.79
at last cried	25.30
have you cords to bind him with and gag to stop his mouth we	80.07
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place	473.84
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the	121.90

she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to	268.70
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal death as deliverance and even opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his	204.38
besides to tell truth whilst artagnan was quite disposed to adopt subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open	314.41
lions of roman crowns and which	21.10
here am milady here am cried kitty springing forward to meet her	63.34
the two witnesses	55.08
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the	207.42
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la	1134.84
at this moment villefort returned followed by the lady maid and her came madame de	34.94

those invincible men were subject to mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with	266.16
therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her	600.39

he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his	224.03
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for man who is to be shot at seven clock tomorrow	73.92

but you are sure you will promise me this said morrel	65.06
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer few words as he looked around on the	167.59

if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to	248.93

overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by artagnan all for one one for	226.35

franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and short delay the count joined them in the	349.65

the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day	68.14

not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo dead father or husband is better than dishonored one blood washes out	219.54
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more	135.11
well that is precisely the feeling which experienced when first saw that extraordinary	54.88

but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of waiter at the hotel card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil du helder on the_ may half past	289.67

at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite	23.03
are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled by whom by the joices the prinns the cromwells by tailor coachmaker brewer ah hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah what is he himself asked madame	344.68

good morning creditor said he for wager anything it is the creditor who visits	221.27
we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the child whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching	254.64
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the	146.11
thank you la ramee said the	14.87
touching unanimity cried artagnan which well becomes good citizens like	188.39

is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is	139.18
why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the	21.37

ah ah you incline me to think so said the	60.93
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything	104.99
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my	84.26

this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year and related to the true	63.66
here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was	271.26
his person had undergone change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were	451.07

edmond was intensely	63550.37
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was sort of reflection upon	140.63
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	65.62
the concierge who attended him had only been there	33.14
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before	182.34
they set out passing over the pont neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called abreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand	215.90

artagnan shook his	5.75
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange	78.84
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard	59.90

he is going to fall cried	100.75
you are precious creature my pretty hostess and am much obliged to	67.29
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with passport signed for	119.21

well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his	326.03
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	25.87
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn or at least	66.79
give him direct invitation but do not ask me to present	48.23
but what the matter raoul said athos very	39.67
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august	528.79

sometimes albert would affect to make joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his	306.67
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	106.55
my father answered with loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two	125.22
good caderousse so much so that yesterday would not take the two hundred	39.20
de villefort her devotion to the elder	28.31

se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di	201.03
and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty come therefore to ask what has become of him villefort by strong effort sought to control	199.99
that is well do as have directed you	26.16
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious	103.55
should the king prove tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there	680.22
here said milady rising with the majesty of queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for pure young girl the victim of the brutality of	286.34
anne of austria re entered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with	218.59
now sir said madame de villefort must bid you	60.76
bonacieux uttered little cry and	212.28
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into	111.88
perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other	230.24
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of	34.44
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of artagnan or rather of planchet artagnan had saved his	267.38
carriage was in readiness at the	23.97
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was	22.47
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the	165.85
yes my poor girl replied morrel come to bring and to hear bad	72.61
do you understand that my dear franz no horses he said but can we have post horses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for	198.94
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of vessel would have availed them so	324.67
monsieur artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in hollow tone monsieur artagnan shall die indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he	274.09
does the count know what answer you received yes showed it to	26.32
approach then said the messenger or will come nearer to you if you prefer	20.50
monsieur said the steward it is fatality am	24.63

danglars was disagreeable certainly but know how much you care for his ill	52.20
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney	256.04
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them the scotch inquired	111.86
how much do owe this gracious prince what is there would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the	236.31
you cannot be speaking seriously athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to	74.02
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two	39.43
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the	454.33
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint	224.97
the englishman appeared to reflect moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth consider it	165.63
dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on	257.92
by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent	159.75
the first time saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his	167.63
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is	139.54
alas he exclaimed how can restore the happiness have taken away from these poor innocent creatures god help me	205.47
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by	59.68
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards	43.18
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed very bad	206.81
hush said grimaud he is coming	23.00
will he be at home at eight clock this evening doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were	64.25
bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by spring closed	29.21
and what will you do in that case shall pass through those who attack	61.99
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the	377.47
very easy thing if your horse isn	173.29
hush don let us talk politics my	36.73
and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the	118.23
anne of austria returned to her oratory	142.40
man whose name is franz épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring	138.11

there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass	168.69
kitty entered to bring some	98.50
this instant sir this instant beseech you said the old	37.87
do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three	144.48
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the	120.21
caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it am gaspard caderousse at your	70.15
perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with smile of	78.02
noirtier also have fallen victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte	385.69
and the duke smiled with smile at once sad and	26.55
they will no doubt bleed him therefore will retire for cannot endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband	199.78
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly	99.01
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the	35.91
now barring all that mean to say she is deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which confess inclines to something softer gentler and more	503.99
quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and will conduct you to	41.57
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine	126.51
as artagnan pursued his investigations more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by horrible anguish his respiration was broken and	333.65
artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended	164.25
the duke however was not	145.98
he remembered the count of monte	6.94
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their	321.84
there are the acts signed deliver them to you without	74.97
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve	187.71

monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied	28.17
in the	47.50
this musketeer had just come off guard complained of having cold and coughed from time to time	513.01
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but can be severe with him he is really	346.95
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to	45.48
grief has stunned him replied avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur	86.47

remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men	129.94
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is	119.25
ah ah said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly	54.03
the tenants of the humble lodging were young couple who had been scarcely married week and seeing them dantès sighed	397.27
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the	197.80

twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next	29.25
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went	24.56
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long	95.93
another flash illuminated all around	272.48
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal	70.02
if you deprive me of that take away my life	63.05
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when strange looking man an arab negro or nubian at least black of some nation or other at signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had most wonderful	846.50
it was four clock when dantès was placed in this	48.49
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in bracket against his name edmond	136.76
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my	57.99
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise you are right in some degree when wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to go to	502.56
the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with gravity which already partook of	138.88
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of	156.23
family affair athos had invented the phrase family	49.68
your mission is not accomplished exclaimed artagnan looking in astonishment at	46.22

so that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old england you see how we snapped up the	225.69
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in friendly way to	137.65
therefore kitty	2302.18
not at all it interests me very much cried artagnan and at this moment have absolutely nothing to	52.00

well you soon become tired of singing and you take fancy to study diplomacy with the minister	173.47
artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to	27.07

artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend house shaded by mass of sycamores and clematis which formed vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like shadow issuing from the rue	266.94
ah if were but learned in theology should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur should know what doctrine he leans to and should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his	233.59

upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de	157.38
danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him	330.07
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between	65.35
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise artagnan	160.68

madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on	150.77
my good fellow said château renaud the count is your friend and you treat him	52.14
artagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the	28.99

at the moment he went out piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by	94.16
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about	37.08
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not	302.64
the king looked at the	12.80

artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go	21.35
imagine man who has transacted business with me for don know how long to the amount of or francs during the	65.97
long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were	297.76
of what asked the priest anxiously and	25.07
such was albert opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change	171.25
why didn thou do as thou didst to the first man said	77.20
have known you four days have loved him four	40.07
at last in an hour the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in low voice at the	56.84
well eugénie what is it you want with me and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our	314.53
one was the notary the other that of franz and his	16.24
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him will readily give him the one and promise the	62.29
obey said noirtier intelligent	31.23
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like ninny as he	351.46
then my friend take back this ring to which see you attach much	70.75
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of	240.06
now then said andrea while dressing himself ll wait till he leaves and then ll slip	164.18
you have made up your mind at last my lord said	60.85
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune means of temporizing and obtaining good	135.33
know not why but feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime yes see too plainly that it does	59.84
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken	105.00
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea	128.44
your excellency does not require permit for the island is	67.68
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for	120.03
and why today rather than yesterday or tomorrow what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas this wound my dear artagnan has been warning to me from	214.31
hold there carriage coming over	174.03
oh sire exclaimed the duc de	8.16
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his	71.73
so much the worse and so much the better it need not be said that artagnan was still thinking of the	89.60
the countess	1960.94
ah said monte cristo is not	56.73
quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on very	59.70
and what did you do with that letter put it into my	50.12
fencing boxing and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles	307.07
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the	19.13
and you my dear boy shall stay here for few days longer we must accustom ourselves to	139.57
have son too and should be very wroth with those who detained him from me three months	306.12
have only the letters of ali tepelini which have placed before you the ring token of his good will which is here and lastly the most convincing proof can offer an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military	330.25
old dantès however sprang	19.37
ah here is one of them	34.43
good day monsieur dulaurier replied	97.08
think you ought to do nothing since you exacted promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in	91.87
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to	115.29
coquenard had seen	314.28
am then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit	173.22
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is most singular	131.04
you shall have all	38.00
no do not seek any longer to discover the	77.96
noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other	66.33
if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of	152.02
these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and	152.02
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish	87.62
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their	235.62
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is	86.33
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first	85.92
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of	135.08

épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by decided feeling of avarice but that is	314.57
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of stiletto into the bosoms of his	235.92
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count stopped before the hôtel de	80.14
and now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the	130.26
do you not guess monsieur asked	39.39
monsieur artagnan murmured	84.87
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the	77.16
then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said	18.76
it shall take but quarter of an hour answer for everything madame believe me know the people they are like great child who only wants	167.71
and by doing so monsieur the governor said artagnan you will deserve well of the	42.68
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the	73.34
these last words produced prodigious effect on the	646.30
that well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	71.25
trust you have brought this rabble to	127.43
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed deeper	131.71
thank god we don want either rope ladders or gag pears	357.63
de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of	158.37
so strange reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her	333.38
how you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be	126.69
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this	148.73
ah maternal love is great virtue powerful motive so powerful that it excuses multitude of things even if duncan death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her	351.29
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that fair bet	165.56
we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them	358.39
with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine room of which he double locked the	95.23
bah said albert	193.08
little acquainted as am with the habits of parisians should not have thought this the place for such	99.97
artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although	45.39
at least that will conciliate us all said	98.19
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his	498.77
but send me word should you be arrested for then will return	67.49
he was foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua	136.73
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of goat was	106.64
no no have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their	178.85
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as friend or even as father he worshiped him as	131.90
he had now leisure to look to his	41.10
and remember that am waiting for	17.65
shall kneel down to pray do not strike	73.40
come said he to the abbé am anxious to see your	33.29
it doesn surprise me said artagnan in low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had crushed the life out of his	131.42
and who has abandoned you is that it have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days have obtained proof to the contrary for which thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten	114.95
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said	33.77
was still unable to divine for what	76.90
yes raoul replied the	23.26
to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering	60.31
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the of the golden	78.88
and where are these four men ah that is what do not	33.22
at present confess that is the thing stand most in need	48.19
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous	116.07
whither would you have me go without friends without money in part of france with which am unacquainted and where have never been before oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being	242.18
it has been made up long time said	29.77
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as sentinel at his	192.06
the hinges of the door creaked and man appeared in the dress of cavalier wrapped in brown cloak with lantern in one hand and large beaver hat pulled down over his	111.79
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of	37.58
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel	56.61
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom have sent unto	477.96
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for	75.39
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of	245.25
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall call one of the servants yes replied	71.12
yes said cromwell you have done since knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been faithful friend cautious negotiator brave	141.25
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy	168.32
this corridor was guarded not by sentinel but by confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful	585.81
no no continued the count had to avenge myself it is not thus would take	35.86
so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what happiness it is to meet again indeed it is so long	202.20
inutile desiderium	1129.45
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of	29.88
shall hear from you	41.45
will stop at the first posting house said danglars to	66.25
said caderousse astonished who told you was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye	170.64
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken great liking for the captive	123.63
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely	869.35
don let him escape said loud	22.25
was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	38.18
laporte said anne of austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress	195.24
this to me who expected but to find blank enclosure surrounded by straight wall is assure you most agreeable	296.55
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte	62.57
de tréville at distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that may growl at	70.31
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday an hour	73.89
and you ought to thank her	120.96
porthos drew back	113.94
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with	83.17
demoustier says and will not retard its course or disturb its	256.63
questions and answers followed in nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé love and respect equal to his	141.57
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of	92.31
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy	95.20
where if you please behind the luxembourg that charming spot for such amusements as the one propose to	60.54
as to artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of cornet of the	123.29
the devil my dear athos you view things on the dark side	51.91
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be	37.23
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the	26.35
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit therefore he has gone and am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating	341.96
happy asked the count	15.58
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as daughter loves	192.50
do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him lead two sheep to the butcher two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with	339.37
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is	557.76
madame replied valentine he has not even	77.09
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre	260.71
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had	53.17
full of this idea villefort face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling	156.85
just then handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de	145.96
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this	42.15
nay know not some evidence required from us	88.72
the young woman hastened to meet	9.40
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of	350.38
well shall	47.00
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his	21.09
artagnan recognized the	69.43
and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied artagnan in low voice beg you to follow	90.48
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	70.83
and of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron	129.60
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me widow any hour continued she throwing significant glance at	121.09
and what grimaud	290.78
sign my lord and he gave him	55.30
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais	27.53
she has been punished	28.84
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the	18.81
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	38.55
and artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to artagnan to serve him as	61.96
this movement revealed the spot where winter body had	64.84
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low voice as hardly to be heard by madame	99.97
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one can	64.18
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with	209.13
athos went to pay visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse and wrote the following letter to artagnan dear friend am about to set off with aramis on important	107.17
bring in the monsieur artagnan said the commissary to the	26.40
see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal guards have so many	279.59
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare	349.29
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the	156.24
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not	198.46
this was in fact the worst complaint of louis	25.96
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like	240.68
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery half circle inclosing the court of	247.87
an excuse for us to meet artagnan with false excuse to have to make false excuse to porthos oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant heart not wholly dead to	234.69
the first advantage had been gained by	21.49
he began his day by breakfasting substantially bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two clock he had his two horses saddled and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la	304.57
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and	63.10
monte cristo	913.43
now say if conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his	80.85
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the	25.85
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring hole through the	75.56
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to breath that could be interpreted as	129.93

athos sighed	52.61
it is like that turkish phrase of molière that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its	240.35

grimaud bowed in	614.24
besides the king am certain awaits your majesty reply before risking	139.17

the judges proud of having monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his	234.83
it is long time madame said the procureur describing half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is long time since had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and regret that we have only now met to enter upon painful	205.09

then it is for to day asked the	73.39
the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the château if which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful	354.89
that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it deposited with the justice they said it was bad	198.13
the two friends exchanged simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his	113.89
maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike	193.10
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably	215.02
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my	224.83

when do you mean to set out tomorrow at	97.55
now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending	175.47

what have you discovered asked	29.33
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of	319.82
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented	66.08
then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to athos say this to him in english you are	204.24
well he of whom speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in	176.46

he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy	59.45
very brave said monte cristo have seen him sleep with sword suspended over his	73.13
to the swords be it so replied artagnan that is exactly what	30.48
said maximilian but don attach any serious importance dear to what your father	63.69
it was therefore near seven clock but edmond anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his	143.68
in who made him baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button	132.53

no the earl of essex tis true wore splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst have nothing but simple circlet of gold with cipher on it and date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinal lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed	745.05
de tréville post dated the leave to the morning of the twenty	209.33
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of drowning	44.69
artagnan was radiant with joy and	159.39
and how does he behave towards travellers alas his plan is very	333.80
unruly comminges smiled you wish to terrify me	144.52
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind screen of poplars little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed	879.29
where will it take me where you please you have put me on shore at	81.43
good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us	156.00

there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt	99.79
de villefort of the impertinence of his	181.61
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in	36.17
had thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did albert	87.36

artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last artagnan pulled him by the hem of his	148.97
but do you suppose carry five hundred francs about with me should want	80.53
what is this said aramis on seeing them	155.79
you prohibited my mentioning my father name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful	213.35
artagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read	180.34
second look was exchanged between athos and	14.85
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in gilded	314.69
near the merchant signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime	76.62
thanks to the garden we yet can flee have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late	80.89
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested little we can	87.14
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady neck would be smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos	864.28
milady clarik received artagnan	1185.09
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common	451.22
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor door and knocked	123.17
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurator wife with	53.16
danglars but am quite as incredulous as he	49.14
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp	42.96
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his	124.70
did you come to tell us you have procured carriage asked albert lighting his	94.90
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention share of his prize money but jacopo refused it	203.01
these are doubtless your family arms except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them am very ignorant of heraldry count of fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of commandery of	684.76
yes yes yes continued the old	5.86
laugh if you please really think	16.15
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called	217.13
sdeath would die willingly for the king but supposing happened to be killed on account of mazarin as your nephew came near being to day there could be nothing in paradise however well placed might be there that could console me for	262.15
you are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and will depart as quickly on	92.04
take it such as it is for have not the time to procure you	20.61
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words but imperfectly caught shall be delighted to answer	75.01
as result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to certain degree of	132.18
overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway enough said mercédès enough edmond believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and tell you freely that the comparison draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest	365.39
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert	161.07
am planchet planchet whom you know	39.09
how so you were looking the other	22.07
that is it madame that is the	18.06
go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing small phial you will see there half filled with red looking	174.92
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial	381.05
and what friends awaited him without he had friends then five years in prison if that were so he was indeed highly favored	178.93
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be	175.76
amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and am sure you will understand me artagnan was the getting from this woman kind of blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of	218.01
his eyes dilated and shudder ran through his	42.70
let us go and die with them said the	25.19
then saw no more but heard the noise of breaking	30.80
ah blood how you have hurt me my shoulder quite	68.88
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger	227.92
no dear morcerf you know only refuse when the thing is	35.24
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years	35.50
and too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is	45.08
who informed you this was the master propose to you devil take it he muttered to himself don let me betray my secrets to man not inclined to entertain	127.27
yes count it is strange thing and one which might astonish you but feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder	129.34
alas alas sir have pity on me the old man eyes remained fixed on the	42.11
monsieur herblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once more this evening how can you doubt it replied aramis this evening to morrow always command	130.52
very well said the cardinal and you monsieur aramis monseigneur being of very mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me wound with sword treacherously across my left	296.27
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent	346.14
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet	26.12
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and	129.76
this very instant	81.71
listen captain baldi there one way of settling this said	161.10
porthos as we have seen had character exactly opposite to that of	37.27
oh dearest marie she thinks of me then five years of separation heavens there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his	451.00
he opened drawer and took out	382.91
see you to tell you that everything separates us the depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of	111.26
there go two miscreants said he it is pity they are not really related then an instant of gloomy reflection come will go to see the morrels said he think that disgust is even more sickening than	321.74
he had been struck to the heart by frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran death recurred to him these symptoms to less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of	164.85
to get away you would not mind you added knocking down door or	101.50
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger remarked	183.20
anne questioned artagnan by	58.98
carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage	142.35
understand said the	73.98
the sultan the liberty of woman replied the count the pope the life of man so that once in my life have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of	117.04
have received no orders on that	69.98
are you priest asked	21.78
it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other	113.50
perhaps you had spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem	134.15
your excellency carriage is at the door said	18.17
monte cristo stopped and examined it	69.29
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my	66.63
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went	64.15
de salvieux to do	78.63
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet artagnan had recognized the voice of his old	61.45
it was dark and silent as the	47.44
the guards of the cardinal and why so asked porthos	36.19
mousqueton sir answered voice from the depths of the	16.58
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his	586.00
no replied monte cristo god grant may not have done too much	65.59
but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make plume for his	498.19
he was accompanied by two of the yacht	71.60
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the	205.71
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of	125.90
no monsieur replied the young man will remain with monsieur le	39.43
the count listened and said no	20.04
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or	267.85
the cousin was received with resignation that was	32.46
stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had not been told that when you travel much it is	40.91
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat	270.01
everyone expected an explosion on carlini part but to their great surprise he took glass in one hand and flask in the other and filling it your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the	243.96
ah he ll come round thought artagnan that not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to artagnan with his hand and addressing the two	283.12
you know dear artagnan am nothing more than good honest country	50.86
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created peer and this marriage broken off without reason being assigned yes it is all from the same	252.06
hush hush replied franz we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes as franz spoke he heard the sound of door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young	206.75
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence	151.26
oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count take	38.64
you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with	358.74
avrigny would not accuse anyone speak only of an accident you understand of mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to	142.47
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are lot of	155.78
then shall really have them oh well said the count do not think you have yet known the want of	41.51
then there is no revenge our conditions said no revenge you will please to	67.30
all that you tell me of those by whom am surrounded monsieur artagnan is doubtless true said the queen but have confidence in you	69.81
do you wish to go	8.56
here are the horse hoofs again it seems athos he said	77.73
did you bet oh merely paltry fifty	394.80
then was heard great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself	291.36
and that father is well caderousse it is monte	16.06
the banker uttered groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor	116.38
what make the first advances said the	51.04
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded	502.18
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of	251.29
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and	52.41
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her	148.08
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle robe and spend all your time reading your	250.66
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly	79.08
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was	32.01
how can he be the son of great lord natural	18.76
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the	219.60
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other	255.33
sir said he that man has been	43.87
athos put his arm around aramis neck and embraced	42.66
death alone can separate them remarked	230.55
around in the crevices of the rocks grew few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of	427.79
oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been crime we will investigate	97.39
come then said the prince let us lose no	8.65
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of	128.77
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full	20.87
but not before one clock replied	15.39
thinking of all this and from time to time giving touch of the spur to his horse artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at	155.30
oh he was not gentleman ll answer for it besides he did not wear sword and the others treated him with small	93.23
de saint méran said madame de villefort then this house belonged	39.12
have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen	58.23
great god cried artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	153.64
one may be jailer or keeper and at the same time good father and	42.92
the trial at eight clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp	44.45
ah monsieur hypocrite understand how you study	95.72
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner	72.13
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	64.74
it is but christian charity replied artagnan not to lead one neighbors into	269.02
the young people uttered cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again	63.84
this time will know the assassin and will pursue	22.37
no said morrel is someone dead in his house the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great	159.29
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten	37.54
shall you see the king again	31.80
in two days and by using up two or three horses that nothing have plenty of money am at	224.45
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to	79.35
what could you do against dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh they should kill	627.19
if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile am the bearer of an order of arrest and although most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be	222.45
quite so replied the	87.60
instead of aiding the movements of my horse paralyzed them and was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until	190.39
he sees us on the road which leads him to bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his	134.80
and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes can easily comprehend	316.34
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	64.49
but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her	526.05
now whither do you conduct me into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of	147.01
and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and am come to france to seek	159.50
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the	56.11
has mankind treated me as brother have men loved me have they spared me has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands no madame they struck me always struck me woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that ought to blush well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others never rest till have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their	603.88
explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful business you had such warlike	204.54
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of man of no	320.04
in very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the	23.42
morrel shook his head	115.89
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them learned it	81.42
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of artagnan who however placed himself between him and	362.00
good god to imprison him monseigneur why he imprisoned himself swear to you he	112.43
yes sir will give my attention to the	78.92
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of naval	99.87
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already	299.25
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had kind of repugnance to	81.11
no no look look the recommendation was	51.16
and you porthos faith am going to fight because am going to fight answered porthos	61.84
the sergeant began to	47.69
our blow has failed for to night let us	104.50
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the	59.66
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men faces and figures as very good specimen of his	204.95
hum said gondy laughing was not aware my alms were so well	138.52
no said	197.99
now saddle the other three	38.01
he had retired at one clock under the pretense of being	95.16
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an	118.04
yes but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and one name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that muttered	255.94
oh yes said de winter for they are the same	21.51
do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will	68.96
valentine tell him if you love	16.30
you suit me very	12.52
has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has scar on his	416.22
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost	178.53
morrel looked at his watch which wanted quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past	172.72
indeed still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed	49.12
by whom by bonaparte or at least by his	118.58
although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the	620.82
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing	94.74
ah ah said the cardinal know of whom you	16.78
have you no idea whatever none at	25.61
but what know is that promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are	33.34
the valet ran	24.12
see what is going on monsieur artagnan said	15.07
the sergeant of this company veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of	278.28
let me see	16.97
here to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and	104.66
well will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but will not drink	83.16
milady secret chapter	240.06
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palais cardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to	33.40
tell him all this for me for these are things which king cannot say for	33.50
courage we have them but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have	49.95
go to england join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every	208.20
de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with	137.43
lord de winter tore his	513.72
morrel said he do not forget what you have just	32.32
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	16.89
oho said they not in bed at quarter past	47.49
do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest	86.71
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and	139.83
come caderousse no nonsense said	16.61
it was situated in very private	44.65
go to it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said	68.73
did you drink some	55.77
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre	197.34
then turning to the baroness may ask how mademoiselle danglars is said	23.43
plan of campaign chapter	322.08
at the same time he pointed to window through the shutters of which faint light	44.85
what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	31.24
athos porthos and aramis having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such disturbance that the provost of the castle rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much	413.56
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him	65.86
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the	129.77
four large vessels recently built had just been	185.21
now to see things which cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my	93.89
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the	43.85
but do not keep raoul with	17.11
light cloud passed over the count	17.01
it is impossible gentleman could have written such letter to	41.70
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you	42.10
come on come on said artagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps have not thrown away my half	103.18
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the	102.62
this commissary was man of very repulsive mien with pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the	488.42
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the	115.45
give your orders and we will execute	90.97
rave said morrel well then appeal	60.11
you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around	75.47
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state	31.08
de tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me	54.50
at solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the	66.01
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it	265.02
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was	42.38
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend	209.46
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us	175.56
and that ghost told me morrel that had lived long	103.64
knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten	48.48
but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie saw you arranging deposit is not that the term of five millions and half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable paper did not dazzle my eyes like	284.38
de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence therefore sent them to the king	208.22
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	66.58
you are fifty five years	20.23
yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken	206.54
artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	171.28
you are poor and your future prospects are dark and	532.19
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional	363.74
then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port	77.96
well what would you have me do said the	21.44
it is not who	118.11
artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed sign of	54.98
madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech shall convince your majesty trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at	165.54
comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that	126.23
yes returned	184.19
that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your	113.70
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the	56.84
artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the	29.00
te deum for the victory of	6.30
edward he stammered edward the child did not	29.73
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or	105.11
why then didn you reply because these horses are not to be sold was the	80.88
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as vice becomes almost virtue when looked at in the light of maternal	125.22
this time without knowing why artagnan felt cold shiver run through his	354.70
he opened his mouth to reply but with haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	152.03
artagnan made violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too	100.38
he felt something like secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous	198.43
against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself whom would they hang yourself or me well can weather the storm whom notwithstanding you tax with fear not with bravado that is not my way but am	190.30
it concerns the best interests of your father said the	54.44

the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the	113.99

then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the	560.69
at last said he shall know with whom have to	28.06
artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	109.24
so that for trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg	137.83
have you seen him left him five days ago said artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur	509.07

the king looked at aramis with	12.84

he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion	183.27
but what is to be done said	14.45
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was viscount recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing descent and genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres more than sufficient sum to render him personage of considerable importance in	964.54

now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible could act with such cold blooded	681.27
and you come asked	40.43
what we are going to say does not concern your	45.03
agreed shouted the three musketeers in	27.95
he then asked with whom he	49.96

noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended	60.31
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid visit to	307.52

then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man head he slowly added by the blood of christ swear never to leave you while you	168.07
let us wait for dénouement for the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the	44.14
noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or	60.68
ah ah said he she is asleep that	23.67
hark said she we have been overheard someone is coming all is over we are lost no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the	108.76
there is dupe	4024.92
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you	64.78
shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where shall find good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to	282.14
have something important to reveal to	48.56
don alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and will contrive	347.51
as am only humble foreigner you must pardon me if do not understand all the subtle refinements of your	217.50

now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we	30.76
she heard him enter but she did not raise her	53.63
he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the	120.95
but artagnan artagnan if he comes shall we not know it how nothing	44.22

insolent wretch cried	107.86
to congratulate me what for on the capture of charles	43.52
de wardes that provoked her	225.38

he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and	328.36
am to accompany you your excellency cried	27.38
and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed madame danglars departure before he left the	69.53

danglars was quite annoyed by the young man	47.87
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over	570.97

adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while	166.20
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same	63.44
answer in your turn or you may repent of your	60.43
it was still about quarter full as we before	53.53
beauchamp availed himself of albert permission and left him promising to call for him at quarter before	88.61

in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris artagnan had no time for prolonged love	261.75
nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom am anxious for trust he will conduct himself like gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale	298.73

at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five	287.00
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank	154.62

how do you know yes which catches the thief in trap and plays	207.74
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	139.85
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more	155.75
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his	23.03
holland loved her and she responded to his	30.72
sometimes we don go to bed at all well what of that why he would be annoyed if did not play with	87.75

they carried him through an alley up flight of stairs and deposited him in an	127.39

the army will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police	180.04
my dear count we have only just	55.25
sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of candle which traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that living being dwells beyond the silence and	518.04

does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no he is subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the	460.63

oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with	48.26
and now my good friend said artagnan to him must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and	114.29
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the	80.47
let us put down added albert	78.91
morrel to come and claim me at my own	31.96
poor fellow said	44.02
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mère simon son who has not chosen the worst	232.04
felton grew pale and made step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had rope in her	71.66
plague stifle you and your latin said artagnan who began to feel all his patience	159.67
de villefort multitudinously is good said château	64.74
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large beard and hair so long now barber would only be surprised if man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of	293.88
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of resolute	871.08
stop see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward	65.52
yes added planchet like the famous ass of	126.88
when the soldier saluted charles athos heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his	252.11

exactly so cried	15.64

yes said morrel smiling it was the th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power endeavor to celebrate it by some heroic action interrupted château	248.98
the young man who one evening sought quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the	60.06
good said the	301.50
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me	43.26
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join	141.79
why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not	28.08
well well cried artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep think it is the	114.44
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	58.12
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you	27.46
really sir artagnan said to him am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor	57.77
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately	56.06
indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us	79.67
morrel threw glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still	85.30
am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and have promised to adhere to his	413.99
one of the persons whose conversation overheard was the master of the house the other the	23.59

these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	185.81
le duc de la	19.28

no sire replied	14.56
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with loose rein in other	367.60
there will be no necessity for me to make note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me have the plan sketched with all the living reality of	162.07
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant	202.59
wretch exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go	92.81
what do you say inquired charles	50.62
as artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been	78.62
perfectly well quite rested	88.81
artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed	97.80
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	27.13
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around	36.07
this could not then be military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular	76.11
since you demand my resignation	140.61
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponent weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in form apparently so feeble but thanks to parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his	363.63
he has come thought	122.32
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and	126.94
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our	125.60
it is certainly the king said the man rising	21.29
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of post chaise is an	79.37
as to bazin he went and lay down on truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with cardinal	199.46
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was beginning of vengeance which filled his	209.32
speak italian	66.20
she soon whispered to her husband think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in	165.12
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	63.28
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe blow through her husband and	114.80
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do	104.33
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man am artagnan don you know me where is your master you monsieur artagnan cried grimaud	58.13
you don choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned artagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my	149.20
speak speak one can say anything to	54.84
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of	63.42
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	104.68
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and	40.41
six hours he left pierrefonds he was at saint	64.43
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue	44.82
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first	125.29
single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	58.11
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we	42.92
don believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial trial would make noise and noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de	324.11
thou mayst add that thou hast risked it	312.02
in quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and	108.83
silence and fatigue together overcame artagnan and sleep overtook him	186.45
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it duty for me to offer you my	398.31
in an instant space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family	436.79
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad	177.31

well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which rode	61.43
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such glance as is best understood by mortal	73.96
benedetto he muttered fatality half past six clock has just	87.46

the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate	411.21
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to	46.20
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort would follow him to hell and that is saying not little as believe him entirely capable of the	228.36
we even joked very pleasantly if remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my	191.27
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing	48.35
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance she knew him she knew that at her return from fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had	340.76
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and mistrust	220.45
leave your hold then beg of you and let me go where my business calls	64.97
and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to	133.51
trust me don let us try to do things	57.01
oh sir said artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and	102.60

we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us	70.11
yes said	275.28
and porthos heaved another	36.14
yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please	72.98
it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of	118.26
mazarin disappeared as they rose from	99.92
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each	232.54

then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing letter which he addressed to madame la baronne	431.55
alas have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity forgot those old friends monsieur because have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own	455.70

it is incredible no my dear fellow it is not at all	43.07
kind of steward appeared just as artagnan and his companions were prepared to	77.12
always had desire to have mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out went to the bey and proposed to give him for ali splendid double barreled gun which knew he was very desirous of	333.50

far from wishing my lord to quit paris hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is great	194.77

but they will contest the will your death	562.94
remember that he will most likely be disguised as	97.18
oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands	67.80
de tréville was asking artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an	105.15
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the	59.16
misfortune refreshes the	305027.53
wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness	791.63
these words were uttered in tone which made morrel	62.03
but the voyage was not	19.01
with your brother yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his	157.98
speak then am all	61.04
villefort dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility	207.41
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered	17.72
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the	179.23
and you couldn remember	316.00
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is	59.66
let us try not to jest if we	49.37
what do you wish sir asked morrel that should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtier eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his	322.96
do you think so answered artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt	270.52
but where will you manage to stow me in the chamber	93.14
this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not look from monte cristo silenced	137.52
very good said the	13.46
monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid	190.73
morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime	30.96
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his	54.04
and aramis pushed forward large easy chair in which artagnan stretched himself	68.09
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his	20.29
de tréville was as gay and cheerful as	56.47
bravo you ve killed him	105.21
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet	14.11
seeing stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped	359.49
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property	76.98
mazarin returned pale and evidently	52.34
stay said artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the	80.25
danglars turned slightly pale andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing	44.26
you re in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so	57.51
well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening good travelling britzka with four post horses in which one may rest as in	115.10
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down	181.10
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made feint and lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the he had already three inches of steel in his	186.28
god knows would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me happy and affectionate	66.32
no spoke of the duchess de chevreuse did you see her her return from brussels the king death yes she is still	106.93
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching milady bed offered her	65.44
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him	207.15
monte cristo wrote die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon	150.96
ah you remain in london said	32.73
ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his	14.48
gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed don know how many	95.58
wait sir wait said louis	15.47
comminges began to	62.93
you persist then yes am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go	91.14
if it were not so far from here to the house would return and finish	38.18
the throng was terrific and it was not till much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their	263.99
indeed said louise admire you and could almost say respect	76.16
witty he has unfortunately too much	231.33
what telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory oh no should find there people who would force me to understand things of which would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself mystery which even they do not	213.72
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for support superior to the danger which threatened	237.11
his father was introduced to me as marquis so he ought to be count but do not think he has much claim to that	87.73
one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to	32.66
to you alone then may confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned	86.40
very well be here at	26.44
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them cup of	97.07
athos understood all	98.43
no but it may be sent in something	28.03
but there now take him he is your own for as long as you	43.37
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me hope bertuccio raised the lantern and	109.12
come for your commands my lord he	24.75
monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt	353.90
if judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against	32.41
one thing was sorry for when bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little	219.34
de comminges went away artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be	182.03
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped	37.05
had acted hastily towards	35.92
read said he read cannot	135.40
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the	43.99
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and well you the cardinal would have given you letters of	66.30
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before	101.87
and in justice to villefort it must be understood	25.55
am credited on you for six	121.00
ho friend cried	161.03
no no you do yourselves injustice but am here to do you	65.81
as friend and only as friend at this	74.61
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time let us see what this letter	374.54
should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had divulged my own apprehensions to	174.89
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	32.84
that pretty positive continued artagnan but all it is but	113.58
when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her having looked at them	105.80
franz gave him albert	69.48
he is walking about and thinking thought artagnan but of what it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not	74.90
here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were	180.69
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to	240.95
de tréville being there to claim	38.70
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the	22.86
towards the close of the first act the door of box which had been hitherto vacant was opened lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still	120.14
coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of good	163.69
then while passing he had cast rapid investigating glance into the kitchen and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurator wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good	342.85
disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued artagnan for by what see am led to believe that you are confessing to these	78.29
he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah see here is madame returning with	519.37
oh how distinctly remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and feel as if it were still warm on my	70.01
well asked	38.19
oh merciful heavens murmured	100.94
but must	1824.79
it was soon time for grimaud to recall the	26.73
parry too started and stopped	98.34
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions	776.41
pretend to sleep louis said	27.21
my mother gave it to me and fool as was instead of keeping the ring as holy relic gave it to this	191.38
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of	269.17
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and will ask	50.70
you demanded favor said the baron	80.79
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to	52.05
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the	186.83

must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship must borrow from friend the loaf shall eat until have earned	334.31
not breath of wind now disturbed the heavy	158.17
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said	42.24
it was	5907.48
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry	57.24
what is it to leave behind you the diamond you have on your	17.70
great people only thank you for doing the impossible what possible they say they can effect themselves and they are	97.95
what is he then with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying letter to lord de winter he has set up little shop in the rue des lombards and is now	168.25
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same	60.81
will send	109.85
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no	189.15
the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell falsehood we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our	414.17
they know that am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why did not invite	97.80
oh said scarron he may die	67.01
although was without mistrust vague fear seized me and tried to struggle against	146.06
but let it be done explicitly and	246.26
here it is my	25.10
say no more entreat	27.16
what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth either misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against	565.89
milady saw the	1704.90
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was	73.25
and too added	48.07
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by	38.61
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first father then	36.58
there is not hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so	261.07
but am grateful swear to	13.08
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in	136.26
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned	34.14
what is that that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this	47.92
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to seat placed another for	74.85
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as thing already	64.25
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his	24.91
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around	16.64
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden	83.65
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long space of time that they might now come and crush me with this	198.29
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest search search but what have done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither dream nor reality what have done to you tell me then speak you condemned me to horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and	352.61
then he must be	373.74
when you have purchased the estate desire want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern	451.93
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without	102.97
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard noise of people and the carriage	28.72
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses	189.59
the king threw himself into an arm	30.34
ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad	67.31
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to	52.20
the de lis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices	295.30
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	85.70
it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to call his jailer attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity unfortunately edmond brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in	313.78
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times and from that date up to the present day hundred times perhaps so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is	436.78
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around recognized the honest	69.01
now who was that someone that was the question the three musketeers put to one	15.10
you are not boasting do you wish for proof	73.43
did not wish to contradict them besides might be	58.73
ah that is	29.65
oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won get them at	66.14
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four	127.35
your eminence may believe added artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few	151.10
the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of charles still	37.23
yes yes but now what did do with that letter artagnan thought moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old	112.08
nevertheless he pressed artagnan hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment can only do for you that which just now	118.74
now that never happened to us when we were four	44.88
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his	18.18
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud artagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly	104.64
creek to the east in right	18.07
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no	246.00
when he is absent am	67.67
spectre against spectre he murmured in low voice as he concluded his	146.36
you see we were quite right to pacify that	217.83
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his	127.19
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in	197.03
well said albert with sigh it seems you are determined to marry	46.27
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other	45.34
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in low	29.24
laporte place the king in	9.49
my whew that frightful place that bastille only to think of it makes my flesh	289.03
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are	57.66
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush	134.35
yes just	221.06
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound will listen to him with the greatest	84.26
adieu till we meet again apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that should have requested you to acquaint him that in short time he will see whether am as he says too old for	197.38
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortune at least so it is said and beg you to observe that do not inquire merely repeat it is not usual say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this	680.82
and my faith the governor of the province one of the gentlemen expected today seemed to have such wish for him that gave him to	56.74
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle	26.93
he has slept long time on hard bed so he won object to soft one take every care of him beg of	194.31
what do see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans look fernand your eyes are better than	57.59
but do as he has made me baron and field marshal and shall never forget that for these two titles am indebted to his happy return to	210.67
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second	186.71
commend me to the	43.59
when the hour of breakfast came therefore did not hesitate to eat and	52.61
and that one if mistake not	53.43
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much	215.17
speak will	523.10
there was moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing	77.96
at what hour shall we come asked the young	15.61
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of	128.74
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur	122.55
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	57.42
inside the cup was small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to	102.56
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the	86.32
the famous secretaire is in the dressing	24.87
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in	197.75
go and fetch	30.81
but he was man of	236.98
that is also	260.17
bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless	125.51
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat	123.26
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or	115.98
because you do not love me madame if you loved me you would view all this	50.05
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with shade of	100.68

she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in duel in the place royale by the duc de	140.71
then you feel pretty much as you generally do you have had the dose which am accustomed to give you every sunday	94.11
but because you have paid the price of slave do you imagine that have ceased to be your king	58.14
but come expressly for that	45.30
then his admirable nature underwent complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the	291.32
anne then motioned to artagnan to approach and he	50.84
the rest concerns myself don be uneasy about	30.21
the reward of his devotion that of his love was to	37.62
what is it	143.96
ay and very fine one saw him yesterday your friend lackey was leading	56.19
tell me what it	35.09

while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard murmur of words which at length fixed his	751.08

out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it	239.45
but whence have you obtained them listen to me mother and do not yield too much to	239.82
then taking passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months	140.00
finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed kiss upon the paper mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the	270.22
yes yes see him well enough said	12.65
faith yes with haughty presence fine equipage such as the son of noble house would	164.15
what is he waiting for what is he looking at good god have they allowed the headsman to escape suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the	246.37
gentlemen said	516.39
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that	202.82
he is black and cannot speak returned monte	44.32
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish	160.31
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be	168.25
and when he shall have informed him and monsieur laporte is come you will send him to	32.91

oh the champs élysées ah yes we burn as they say at the game of	83.44
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently	56.47
milady looked at this man and	38.95
gondy had not walked hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of	93.17
he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows	466.68
how can know that by the scorn will throw upon	110.17
indeed said danglars becoming	9.95

he has come to draw but don know how much you will know presently my	72.04
valentine took maximilian	36.90
count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed	140.56
wait minute then said	28.24
as usual valentine strolled for short time among her flowers but without gathering	298.76
well ask your worthy jailer what favor this instant solicited of	209.31
my son she said persons in the count situation have many secret	49.59
one would have said andrea anticipated his companion words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for	129.35
he felt carpet under his feet door opened perfumes surrounded him and brilliant light dazzled his	92.15
nevertheless monsieur de tréville company of musketeers alone cannot maintain war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without	117.63
well then let us	89.85
we must let monsieur de beaufort	32.13

you must see that to be an utter impossibility said	70.16
had been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo must believe on seeing	70.38
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at	70.62
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which morrel by the deputy procureur advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort certificates rendered	337.60
give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned	36.96
this was the room appropriated to the	269.15
we will wait then said	37.67
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the	176.78
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of artagnan who arose and replied consider it worthy conduct of pupil of	175.58
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of	158.87
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for would tell her that loved you and she would protect	80.38
will say likewise he had apprised the count by note of your intention and the count being absent read the note and sat up to await	113.92
he rose however as they	36.08
very true replied the gascon but always run away from	61.75
it is not madame bonacieux about whom am anxious cried artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one the	144.48
stop stop cried artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several	893.30
twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer	412.08
at that time was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me however because was prudent you must not take me for	142.04
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady illness yes said the old	262.01
it concerns nothing less said artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	17.82
who could intercept us on such night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at	279.90
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had great respect for	54.30
said looked upon it as sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps	967.03
said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me louis on	333.09
grimaud nodded	2736.07
where does he live rue férou two steps from	63.87
this is terrible said	15.68
who was looking on an eager and curious spectator who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy who like wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course was watching and bitten to the heart morrel	622.50

you know well that don like to leave things half	68.59
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still	37.81
what do you think artagnan asked	15.62
besides our supper can delay you	54.38
never swear my lord say yes or no and as am gentleman keep my	52.80
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god that is the reply beg you to make to lord de	85.75
morrel to be	29219.03
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the	233.06
what is the matter exclaimed artagnan anxiously what has happened to you my lord all is lost cried buckingham becoming as pale as corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	110.43
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his	244.98
the baron took the pen and signed then the	42.31
but replied felton wish to	23.67

you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely was far from france at that	248.25
porthos opened his mouth to reply artagnan made him sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually	154.48

as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and	112.70
in second la ramee was gagged and laid	119.64
albert could not understand the banker look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can tell you because imagine you have correspondents in that	152.07
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the	18.82
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of strange disorder which left livid traces all over the	230.85
draw upon him for francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of francs payable at his correspondent in paris at the end of this	146.38
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her	235.61
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back	445.45
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of	477.29
dare not say more in	109.57

on the other bank replied the	33.00
are you really frightened madame said monte	19.21
knew lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this	147.15
you are right	77.79
why if parisian were to indulge in quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone	335.10
how well you reason said porthos	81.31
épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of husband indeed fear valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter assure	310.23

but the chief without taking the money made sign to him to	18.35

but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to artagnan face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the	184.80

why it is indeed true royal jewel which is worth thousand pistoles if it is worth	85.16
but you cannot break it off in this way the morcerfs are depending on this	219.06
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see the worthy mercer	119.54
benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his	91.44
she wished to know when her lover would meet her second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited artagnan	155.71
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the	75.07
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all	116.48

excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very	53.07
ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of malignant spirit which bids us	248.27
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released	38.02
but since you say nothing remains but	29.13
for monsieur de wardes said	19.81
épinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own	301.18
monte cristo advanced few steps which were heard on the	71.71
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying	20.93
princes must be knocked on the	53.52
admirable said	21.78
morrel asked his daughter for the key of his	11.16
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would give up five years of my pay which am never paid by the way to make the king five years	156.93
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as prince of the holy see or sultan of the and one	556.92
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the	85.23
he was man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by	375.67
then you did not see either of them no but madame de morcerf saw	37.90
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the	78.37
and athos have not yet seen	21.89
yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance	118.15
he told how he had rendezvous with young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the	99.00
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments king more majestic than kings by	211.41
one day you will be able to understand how all this	27.58
they threw themselves into each other arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the	80.19
to old times he	18.57
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman little	118.50
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	59.17
sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir she was my mother her crimes know them not her disorders know them not her vices know them	434.48
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to certain point could not dissemble have learned some fine things concerning your	256.13
noirtier yes think you it was the poor servant life was coveted no no like shakespeare polonius he died for	137.69
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but	115.47
my faith said athos have nothing to say against	50.68
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he	43.06
she fell into so deep reverie that her eyes gradually	132.28
short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz	89.27
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman	56.46
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as am obliged to give you up dead or	173.05
artagnan leaning on athos made sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several	273.70
you would love me as much if were poor would you not maximilian oh shall always love	56.49
he began as you	154.65
might have gone up to him and killed	15.60
the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being first rate sailor she yet was tolerably	262.61
hear me athos said	10.94
he has about him little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german	167.60
this is what you asked for he said and what promised to give	23.61
well well nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as vagabond on the pretext of his being too	88.10
speak artagnan	6.25
tell him will come when leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint	110.74

why not because he is an actor in the	162.83

athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the	140.20
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such	440.06
the king motioned him to accompany	15.42

milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	42.02
thus louis	10.03
dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the	52.17

as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means	824.15

my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen	80.55
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his	262.52

porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	181.43
my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are	284.12

it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling	181.87

that fellow has decidedly bad countenance said the count in tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory	222.77

felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much	74.08
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and	61.86
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore will not speak more fully	75.19

anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to	179.18
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming	94.25

she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of	44.77
the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his	121.26

ah ha ha laughed the three friends not bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to	155.18
my lord who told you that nobody but know	61.32
paltry piece of business murmured artagnan crumpling his	213.79
madame danglars threw rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were friend of mine should ask you if you would sell your	309.09

it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other	36.25
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but	81.53
then artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time very devoted	81.76
friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening	311.40
besides he is an	22.18

my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent	117.53
how young this artagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made sign to grimaud to bring another	101.06
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur long life to his eminence long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings	196.98

lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the	35.55
sir said de winter thought had already made you aware that am weary of this persecution withdraw then or shall call and have you turned out as you were in	322.46

no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue enfer and having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession rang the bell and fled with all	211.30
what company tréville	2.89

these thoughts gilded as they were by last reflection of love were not the less	178.65
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and will return and finish the last	92.13
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself	58.74
the abbé took the	142.36
all at once tall dark gentleman just like yours	139.11
morrel the justice to say that he ran still	39.42
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight at ten clock felton came and placed the	107.39
you are not priest cried the	72.41
you are deceived lucien assure you replied madame danglars and what have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which did not think it worth while to allude	101.11
is it possible you were so kind yes indeed had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow have perceived sort of coolness between	234.24
on the evening before battle one thinks of thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become	164.06
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your	45.92
monsieur said athos that proposition that pleases me not that can accept it but league off it savors of the	143.74
what may that be we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure	136.25
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the	289.65
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come	89.73
but require three weeks preparation at the end of that time shall come and say to you the assertion is false and retract it or the assertion is true when shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you	183.78
sell the crown	27.94
however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my	169.73
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me was wrong hundred times	73.28
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing fishing song of which his companions sung the	142.58
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child oh curses woe death to you he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living	529.86
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering	77.39
officer cried	510.62
monsieur continued dantès know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all	62.36
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by	166.32
and on what will you sleep said	15.79
but before setting out he reflected that for lad of intelligence and experience he was in singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind	368.55
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his	67.58
that gascon cried mazarin with well acted	34.33
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present	132.87
had often seen one placed at the end of road on hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and assure you it was never without emotion that gazed on it for could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of man sitting at table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the	428.81
at the third knock however steps were heard	23.04
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of	75.80
five minutes	72.11
what do you mean sir inquired	22.55
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain artagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an	196.77
albert bowed to madame danglars and advanced towards madame de villefort whose lips opened as he	114.40
ough and not without deal of trouble	55.92
the picture seems to have malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without	166.28
baptistin looked at his master who made sign to him and he went out closing the door	39.61
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged in the capture of king his degradation and his	113.52
he soon arranged prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six	206.41
have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under	585.87
must confess to you count said danglars that have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to	140.66
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that will answer for	31.34
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into coach	320.54

de villefort promise to call on him and hope the visit will be	30.32

mazarin shook his	22.25
artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still	153.98
it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied edmond still	254.23

and the cardinal pointed with his finger to chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited second sign from his interlocutor before he	84.71
faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible	291.56
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father	69.17
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of artagnan	116.95

he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	100.68
de villefort all seek is	47.12
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but swear to you that this crime shall be her	78.15
be it so then replied athos	61.98

it was danglars letter to the king attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs	70.35
twas so then twas so then murmured the	76.05
artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing	97.33
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest	175.83
you will see what fellow he is man who nearly killed mazarin between two	101.08
it had been resolved the night before to change their	37.35

then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared throwing farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the	150.40
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied	100.57
then bring some wine said	21.57
yes my lord hate him said the young	11.05
would you like proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet knew of your arrival half an hour you had passed the	132.68
artagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the	173.98
indeed said maximilian have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has wonderful power of foretelling any future	280.03

gentlemen there was profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other	312.74
my dear doctor there is no communication	53.46
when will it be our turn to think of these things oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer	177.57
halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some	40.01
you have read the letter	30.34
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are	33.47
caderousse was thoughtful for	14.13

do you fear he will not understand	22.04
shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for was	64.73
but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary	20.57
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might	130.35
before he had spoken word the count saw in the next room veiled woman who had followed closely baptistin and now seeing the count with pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed	75.10
monsieur said the cardinal are you artagnan from béarn yes monseigneur replied the young	38.08
michael which came from my	75.17

in one fashion or another you have terrible enemy on your	64.56
they lost her yes	214.27
still further in buckingham lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised	360.28
tent was erected for them near that of the	109.85
they threatened me with	59.63
must seem to you by no means curious but assure you that it is not my fault have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the	108.11
god say the devil my dear friend said artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you	80.63
who are you who are you said the	21.40
the count opened the letter and	19.12
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to	67.56
yes you are right artagnan fatality that will separate and ruin us so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to	154.66
and you will do	57.63
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the	34.37

but said artagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said	46.24
five months he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès	78.29
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some	157.77
your excellency yes	41.28
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained	73.11
have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that might test your character and then surprise	153.37
you are the directors of all	272.69
artagnan went out first as had been agreed	35.56
and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as love you	136.88
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his	269.77
told you so athos said artagnan shrugging his	14.97
but is she safe asked the	37.67
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to	166.33
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange what do you mean beauchamp oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it	475.57
but there is nothing which would do nothing oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help oh am dying oh save me pen pen said the	136.21
let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested	106.25
aramis and artagnan whispered to each	130.96

nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de	70.12
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like fatigued serpent in	367.22
but replied the owner glancing dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from	208.03

oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him it is his son artagnan arm dropped to his	110.01
and you found it traitorous	1307.98
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers moment silence no sir we do	298.40

but she waited in	46.45
you know my opinion of my mother count look at her still beautiful witty more charming than	85.39
no he is man about my own	110.77
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenly he thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless these things always come on us more severely when they come	171.81
albert my child said mercédès if had stronger heart that is the counsel would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its	241.30
the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could	103.66
you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the	17.30
and when shall we know inquired	18.24
that is reasonable said the visitor have heard he had three or four	49.81
actually love no one sir you know it do you not do not then see why without real necessity should encumber my life with perpetual	192.62
you are accused of high treason said the cardinal	54.86
it was thus worded my dear fellow the moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket book which you will find in the square drawer of the add your own to it if it be not	104.83
but will know and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is can see nothing inconvenient in that said the	76.34
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more	71.79
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you	36.02
these words carried ray of hope into fernand	99.40
the queen smiling made sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the	39.00
heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his	61.71
nor hang	39.74
and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his	75.06

coquenard turning about in his chair real feast	183.61
for everything for everything cried artagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself	149.61
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require million beg your pardon interposed monte	562.17
he then gave himself up to his	34.97

let us alight raoul said	40.43
prisoner has escaped from the château if and they are firing the alarm gun replied	120.65
villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not	164.26
be it half million then but on my word of honor had no idea that it was so	59.15
the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth he composed his face as we have before described and said have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the	191.62
let us go to monsieur de	26.22

she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her	111.01

in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and ray of the moon was reflected on the shining	136.59
ah pardieu said artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very	41.10
morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the	120.35

what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will	39.91

the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching	42.31
de salvieux my brother chamberlain yes	94.18
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as	200.11

no but we shall make use of them said	25.39
épinay went on you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against	89.30
do you know villefort that you are talking in most dreadfully revolutionary strain but excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of girondin to be free from small spice of the old	289.10
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that	371.07
yes monsieur know only	42.67
but with the rapidity of thought artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to	276.55

ho ho exclaimed artagnan picking up louis and displaying it here louis that smells confoundedly of	1074.63

good thought the gascon this is promising	46.89
there is still something else said	16.25
the marquis of saint méran returned the	14.89
you are generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what have right to offer you will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and	189.27

then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed thousand pardons really did not observe whom had the honor to receive under my poor	172.24
this time maximilian was the first to	44.19
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor	181.00
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in	50.03
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like bottle of wine with red seal franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of	440.91

why because there is little secret precaution thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse will manufacture you similar one when you are	972.13
he strove to collect band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to	445.26
respect old age but don much like it boiled or	221.56
have if it were only possible to place deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond	108.40

the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little	426.82

my son he exclaimed suddenly where is my son edward edward and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward the name was pronounced in such tone of anguish that the servants ran	91.68
when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away tear when villefort trembling and crouched in corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that may at least know who killed my	554.41

there to his great astonishment artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry	376.25

did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back	171.84

if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said monte	50.33
of what companion are you speaking dear constance of her whose carriage was at the gate of woman who calls herself your friend of woman to whom you have told	99.94
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same	232.04

said villefort fetch the	221.01
yes but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that	80.50
well cried artagnan tell us all about	14.21
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax	514.44
but you come from	71.99
yes you know you	46.93
ah what beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that could talk to him and pat him he is as you see very valuable animal said	170.50
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our	162.23
only their wish to see each other had become necessity and they would have preferred death to day	157.84

athos standing looked at them both with indescribable	96.91
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	21.27
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long	87.85

de montbazon and	4714.76
what is that said the	23.26
artagnan went last still shaking his	14.13
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countess suspicions were destitute alike of sense and	328.51
but even this would have availed little against more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too	367.81
that it said the cardinal that	4.69
yes said artagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you can think that artagnan artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the	220.26
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than	107.39
he had given his word not to watch	32.64
la chesnaye louis	45.76
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen	274.68
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king	15.59
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as bas	332.99
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at	99.00
he is beforehand with us	17.37
one day he was surprised in lonely road between huguenot and catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on	202.32

on reflection my dear du vallon it is great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to	51.47
with regard to artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master	68.16

man advanced to the door with kind of scythe in his	52.51
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how paragraph in newspaper may exasperate	154.98
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is most singular	54.32
yes but we will talk of	14.51
thought you did must have been	33.21
oh reverend sir since you left toulon what have you lived on answer me on what could	136.25

épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person believe	55.01
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing	66.44
milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before	144.73

all four once more	61.48
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his	343.33
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine clock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence	89.18

do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived	151.92
am not allowed to see you madame but you shall every day hear of	30.51
praise god monsieur replied they bowing	83.54

the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows wooden balcony extended the entire length of the	240.86
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of	117.53

he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without	246.32
and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa yes cried morrel make	214.17
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you	23.79
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeurs that is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis	148.93
what is it	70.49
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life	267.66
and who is the man do not	11.10
impossible said madame de	9.26
will answer for	125.28
well replied artagnan bending his mouth to athos ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with de lis_ upon her shoulder ah cried the musketeer as if he had received ball in his	131.54
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the	17.82
you understand no more	88.47
he found tréville in joyful	50.77
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in	145.97
noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the	175.28
forgot there were three more steps before the	36.10
you are right aramis let us travel	38.48
have you sir asked he letter accrediting you to me there it is my lord said the young	45.41
oh monsieur monsieur you will kill yourself cried	46.86
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with carriage drawn by two powerful	153.55
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his	156.92
the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow will set	18.90
they are mistaken bring him here at eight clock sir and may heaven bless you as bless you and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us better my	131.66
and have you them yet no sir sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but have still something	147.47
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about	129.93

faith answered aramis as you see from	30.61
take it	317.96

ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or	514.54
mazarin came within three steps of artagnan and pushed spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its	169.15
duc harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but told him they wouldn look for us where we	377.90
are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw yes there the landlord of the lamb and gros louis the farmer they both live in the rue des	311.64
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg	46.40
may not go and see my friends yes sir you shall see	53.60
and you said athos you forget that you committed very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter	138.13
back shouted artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in moment they were upon them third pistol shot was heard aimed by artagnan and one of his adversaries	368.01
you mean that this demands explanation do you not admit	53.90
this beverage required good half hour to	460.52
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with matter which only concerned	306.65
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state	31.08
and madame danglars will think me very ill mannered	160.19
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the th february and this is the rd of march no sire but am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since left my	238.78
in the king name cried	33.26
attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this	184.42
ah my time is not valuable replied the man with melancholy	34.48
are you not going to put up at the arms of england yes	39.41
danglars hidden behind curtain watched the departure he had been waiting	51.97
then tis something	39.65
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be	175.29
last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested	78.28
they arrived without accident at the rue des	16.75
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo what do think said albert evidently surprised at such question from his companion think he is delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent	312.72
ah capital said	34.27
who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte	19.78
ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding	83.80
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous	89.47
you see madame how rightly spoke when said required preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings	355.16
athos was about to	232.79
the horse said morcerf	37.23
but that is not	19.64
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had	351.80
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte	89.84
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend fat back now sir allow me to leave you for could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded	269.93
the king has nothing like	8.57
however he added turning to porthos should not regret dying sir were sure that by doing so might still be useful to	149.10
thank you thank you murmured	17.77
it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	76.83
capital yes understand everyone would like	14.50
this good major cavalcanti is come to take second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to	99.63
does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly	148.19
mousqueton collected store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the	589.23
artagnan seemed	2355.53
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead go sir count replied artagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you little longer in england well for my part bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to scaffold in order to have better view of the king execution	248.85
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend	26.58
carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to	599.31
what are you about asked	10.31
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the	61.58
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the	18.18
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage joy that under any other circumstances	120.24
then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are	59.63
passing alongside one of them artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom artagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than glimpse of	172.46
they will not dare to refuse me then and will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an	63.19
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key open the	39.15
the story begins	9.03
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and	94.88
and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for saw it	363.02
alas said andrea sighing one cannot be completely happy in this world	205.60
you are right said du	83.32
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw	1945.45
what said	13.12
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well	127.41
as the last stroke died away saw faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just	115.07
you have promised me to go said the	18.40
be more	4631.39
then was ready to dismount but it was too late descended into the arms of the	73.46
the little light in the lodge had long been	47.96
this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young	27.35
this mystery required an explanation at least so artagnan declared to	123.02
the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and	246.67
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me entered as have now done and substituted in the place of the poison healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your	578.11
as to the man to be depended upon have him under my hand monsieur	42.49
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that	540.76
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve	103.09
moment said athos with your permission monsieur wish to speak word with my	34.70
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together	154.43
said danglars have always intended giving my daughter francs as her dowry she is besides my sole	342.17
for what for	113.34
your brother in law is barrister doctor he was merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor	114.87
but now hasten on board will join you there ere	58.17
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him think yes well	57.27
that is quite my	181.13
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons	212.83
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as rush the poor lad strength was almost	122.08
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by artagnan circumstance which appeared to furnish happy augury for the success of his	187.62
that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at	157.96
often ask pardon of god swear to you because this action the only one with which have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject	122.72
what say you morrel foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about	110.19
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true	368.37
pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from bundle of papers letter and showing it to the count he said find here letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de	189.16
beauchamp left the box perfectly	36.32
here is letter have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this	77.24
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them	111.04
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little	207.10
rest assured cried the duchess shall do what	22.97
new source of noise and movement was added to the	69.59
thus all may go well all may be for the best but we do not go far from this place seven or eight leagues at the	63.51
that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear	140.43
grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the	73.99
come now said athos you are	69.36
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was caderousse reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan can you make up your mind fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted	415.37
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour could join her did not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles what can do what story can invent under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing good	917.22
to be sure to be sure cried dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous	178.18
at these words there was murmur along the benches and second voice not that of woman but man stout and furious thundered behind	205.04
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome	126.32
avast there all hands take in the studding sails and stow the flying	130.52
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards oh no of course	32.14
it is not here he	23.69
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood	82.92
the work of revolt continued the whole night	142.35
in france sire at small port near antibes in the gulf of	207.08
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf	83.38
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but man royalty is the gift of	37.56
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	353.10
there are ten men to accompany	42.35
and moreover in taking such step we should appear to be doubtful of	107.71
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the	156.12
the latter to make short cut had appeared on	47.70
and then feel the loss of my house tis long time since visited my	86.12
every blow was accompanied with terrible	65.77
but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one	53.20
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst tighten my horse girth and come back and tell me if there is light in any of the jesuits	188.15
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	42.45
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of	512.58
till we meet again then dear traitor till we meet again my forgetful charmer tomorrow my angel tomorrow flame of my life chapter	194.45
probably said	39.31
bonacieux dead and to artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to	61.92
oh am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak beg of	23.02
as to his going or staying feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to	73.64
and now you will do me favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn	58.30
great age you mean monsieur	19.45
well well the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me last time my brother servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes sign to the postillion and we set off at	162.45
will make verses said	20.60
ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy	81.80
five minutes later he came down the grand	135.05
in what branch in the	130.74
have seen	1082.69
milady mounted upon chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	52.86
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of ball for he is doubtless musketeer	231.28
however there are plenty in the world but you don look in the right direction for them my	37.34
but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make friend about cromwell	73.71
and was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with certain degree of	37.60
you would have done what	35.25
the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and will not	124.37
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of	70.66

say when shall it be speak command will	43.04
de villefort house and long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la	111.85
shall not	923.82
and the two carriages passed on towards their different	67.42
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the	371.24
do you aramis order the	104.36
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of	65.21
wait said	10.19
if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become	30.56
not step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or will hamstring your	71.97
used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and have done all that he did except breaking cord by the corrugation of my	264.06
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	34.03
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just	40.52
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one self not in paris but in	106.34
and feeling in his pocket he took thence small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of	114.53
the jewel is yours my dear athos did you not tell me it was family jewel yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	150.47
villefort was about to retire	20.73
you at marseilles yes says	20.73
it is long since we have had good dinner and for my part have somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry confess to fortify myself with few glasses of good old	224.45
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping louis into his	123.92
and shall we go and find him inquired	21.71
yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the	15.96
no said porthos expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not	38.68
then he descended smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the	241.89
here it is answered the	88.61
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount	16.14
never mind be silent will	62.51
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more	112.34
get in	9217.37
it was of koller building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred	205.11
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue	71.67
intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and half if you do not hear of us take possession of	108.73
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune but he has wealth believe	199.53
well blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for moment from the voluminous scholiast before	242.56
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient	64.16
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by	391.97
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeed very probable thing by the by in gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper	845.65
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied artagnan	72.15
artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him	26.37
but artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with long plume of scarlet	365.40
he visited his own	247.78
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where frightful spectacle awaited	107.25
the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the	84.23
oho said porthos his eyes glistening at the	150.31
never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two	137.86
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in moment they both fell back the host uttering cry of horror and grimaud becoming	146.41
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like	88.19
the two friends made an appointment for ten clock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter	110.46
we should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said	65.92
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his	184.07
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of	128.00
and what is your opinion ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal	101.72
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and	127.50
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate	73.32
dare say you know how to navigate should he fail	124.93
yes replied	584.86
what cried athos are you selling my horse my bajazet and pray upon what shall make my campaign upon grimaud have brought you another said	143.44
he is worse than that he is devil returned the	74.67
what do you think of all this said athos in low tone to artagnan explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in	97.54
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by still greater	191.84
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has	130.81
he remarked that light was burning in one of the highest windows of the	22.57
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found	886.19
he finds the cooking detestable replied	595.97
four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two clock in the morning all the cargo was out of jeune amélie_ and on	305.28
the globe of the lamp appeared of reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of human creature in its final	480.95
wrote in hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on	185.01
yes yes said felton understand how he would	67.29
yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to	33.90

ah said he involuntarily following noirtier eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in	124.61
there will be eleven crowns	173.71

what was the matter with you baron artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais	43.27
at length he found himself at the foot of staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six	50.20
the blaze illumined the sea for hundred paces	81.67
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they	103.28
be civil or shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one	327.06
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to	38.29
how soon can he be here in five	34.19

the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses the style and manner of boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste	713.42
on what was artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling he was thinking of	111.01
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like	130.87
monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three	51.96
nothing could turn him from his	100.28
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	42.02
from the abbé busoni	14.04
what do you mean only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same	82.15
athos foreseeing the period when he should make soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous	277.74
artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into	86.39
good day penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain the	208.44

she slept as prisoner sleeps rocked by his first	332.52
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his	149.90
shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung yataghan and already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his	376.49
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly	431.49
the idea was not that of christian knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my	225.16
what you are ignorant of lord de winter designs upon me	76.56
do not deny the influence of which you speak or that have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than	106.06
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the	38.31
ah am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for	20.59

the frenchman asked for rendezvous teresa gave him one only instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san	116.72
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her	151.51
well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that have just returned from	109.37
piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum tasted for have not eaten or drunk for long	71.33
one of the two men was peppino and the other bandit on the	56.27
oh sir she stammered beseech you do not believe	65.08
but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom bade you distrust asked	142.18
carlini teeth clenched	139.76
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this	99.11
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so	352.94
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each	124.64
he came up with her before she had traversed third of the	87.48
buckingham dead or desperately wounded as left without having been able to hear anything of	113.42
and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now have told you of my love and my hopes may inform you of my intentions yes signified the old	104.51
with me you will be as safe as in temple give you my word of	56.94
the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the	62.47
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with great sword wound through his body it was supposed that had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for	235.50
they continued to admire it but said no more about it and with rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another	118.34
are you not rich yourself my father income is about francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when	149.46
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been	128.11
anyone but man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward extraordinary repugnance for the count projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little	280.79
yes giulio she said proud and happy for have found the means of strangling this	389.66
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred	46.35
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such numerous and promising	177.34
the note is	96.60
and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and	47.20
or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg trademark as set forth in	17.17
humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to	71.34
he lodges at the hôtel des	62.01
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like wild beast in its	126.02
did you see the president at the minister last night	21.67
at the sound of that carriage shuddered soon heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don	98.50
the count went out first then	30.92
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the	75.54
it was said sailor of frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were	124.20
sir he said can tell you what is at present unknown to her	51.18
at the same moment well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel want to speak to the	51.99
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to	65.39
drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs eau est bien prouvé par le	1096.81
to answer you would be to forget	16.72
poor fernand has been dismissed continued	256.43
there was kind of solemnity in this	175.12
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to	148.62
the history of athos imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the	93.87
ah you resist do you cried	78.15
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with sad though affable	46.94
my king said aramis they well may raise scaffold but they cannot make an	59.64
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited	103.85
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very	143.41
what is it you want said the	31.14
know it to avoid meeting him my mother and left	44.72
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important	134.05
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote	125.90
the study does not take long it was acting as supernumerary that was so	122.77
and as to my other instructions asked the fair	48.23
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	158.41
olivain said athos showing the servant raoul shoulder belt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too	235.39
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over large table was tracing on map the route from	86.94
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been friend or the master of the	93.86
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept small inn on the route from bellegarde to	251.80
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy	26.40
and was he not so asked the	22.86
continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not it	288.65
which route must take demanded artagnan in his	56.17
monte cristo made sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio	50.75
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was	107.87
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete	341.32
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted	292.39
it is quite wonderful	87.89
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from	182.15
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale	458.48
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that saved your life that is strange for it is week	83.23
gentlemen said the king to those around him leave you to brave the tempest go before you to kingdom which knows no	63.90
he too ten years ago had piously sought out tomb and sought it	137.59
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to	272.29
and at the same minute carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before	79.83
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that have found that which sought like patient miner have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil	631.07
very well monsieur said	19.83
it was mercédès leaning on her son arm and leaving the	40.55
that was the general opinion sir said the major and yes replied the count and you confirmed the	38.76
from whom asked the	26.84
nothing was	76595.17
yes replied artagnan am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses	131.63
the fact is mademoiselle said barrois am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me cannot say should at all object to drinking your health in glass of	104.94
dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel	24.22
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as	77.89
artagnan approached quickly making sign to his two companions to remain few steps	80.62
cannot replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the	48.09
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine why you have drunk more than hundred pistoles worth am ruined man lost destroyed bah said athos we were always	286.15
monseigneur your eminence is hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary think have not proved myself worthy of your	81.95
in this apartment continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night	188.26
surgeon reverend sir surgeon said	62.17
adieu my friend adieu on the contrary said the count this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in week we shall have left france behind	57.33
one day the young shepherd told the count steward that he had seen wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his	296.05
ask for no	827.11
hum said the host in doubtful	20.28
porthos instead of returning directly home artagnan alighted at the door	28.83
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected	58.99
if you are determined said athos do	35.18
are you looking for anything	51.80
see answered the	161.18
and monsieur leaves me here alone you are afraid planchet no only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that lackey who has the rheumatism makes but poor servant particularly to master as active as	282.15
madame faltered artagnan tis twenty years ago have good memory since had the honor behind piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely	201.33
this point settled the duke turned to	34.79
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for am very	524.32
may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of artagnan had not entirely	123.47
one man alone remained in his place gun in	27.06
farther on still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of	65.04
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	18.14
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the	121.55
the judge	327.08
what are you going to do asked the wounded	17.31
ah that all very fine retorted the	127.89
be satisfied replied felton he will not	121.47
ah indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts	188.60
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles th february delivery	289.98
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of	70.20
it was mixed mass of blue red and	73.52
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint	106.75
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have sword by your side have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve	133.40
was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the	161.18
villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered swear to you by all hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall	417.92
and you did not know that it was inhabited by young man	31.77
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish	54.68
in that case let there be no more question of what past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	94.10
true monsieur le comte replied artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over	248.73
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the	1107.91
porthos nodded in sign of	177.62
no it was somewhere away from here it was do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with lovely sky and some religious mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing beautiful peacock in garden and you madame were under the trellis of some	484.28
from time to time shot from musket or the blade of rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts	378.92
impossible it would be dishonor to all the	51.45
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom have given three sword wounds next milady whose secret have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance have	312.06
oh mercédès have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my	221.27
transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with	264.23
the cavalier made movement as if to follow the carriage but artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped	232.13
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at little hamlet too poor to pay priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by	312.20
slight color mounted to his	69.26
but artagnan was still in desponding	691.21
andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as small square added to the rectangle of the	154.09
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the	216.95
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by similar one conducting to another	159.59
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	78.85
what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense pray do not call what consider the wisest action of my life by such	364.01
has your uneasiness anything to do with	71.95
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is fernand whom you see here is good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with very fine girl named mercédès but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the and as the arrived today why you understand no do not understand said	155.99
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the	84.06
what is that tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my	115.24
so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private	85.59
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to	67.00
what my horse your horse seven against eight point short you know the	68.63
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing	78.26
there were three candles alight each of which burnt before window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and third upon the rue saint	133.51
cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably	58.64
that correct said the	44.31
have you ever seen him	51.67
an admirable subject cried the	352.09
this was blow to	73.14
but pardon said artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in	151.40
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such	440.06
do not reject it altogether said athos but wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be	332.99
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his	185.98
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in	33.94
have you forgotten anything said	46.93
we are alone sir said buckingham speak my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to young woman named charlotte	145.11
de tréville	1526.37
the young men filled up their third of glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do	84.90
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the	50.96
the execution cried	18.81
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de	159.05
yes yes that is	23.70
no that is sufficient man can pass through	24.82
no wounded his horse	36.36
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still nose but his cheeks fattened out each took portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his	446.08
the minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be	179.88
monsieur the coadjutor carriage she exclaimed falling	38.76
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like mask the whole	113.21
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised	112.88
but your release can be	45.68
no madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your	160.92
was the woman handsome young and	57.73
look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood colored drapery and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen villefort became livid madame danglars fell into long seat placed near the	664.90
you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to poison administered to young girl ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my	576.98
at this last thought mercédès burst into flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to	371.71
will prevent	21.25
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether can be of further service to	122.72
will go and take turn in the garden to recover	16.88
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	140.10
two methods of self destruction were at his	519.29
but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that had heavy burden upon my conscience yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward concluded you had stolen that was	162.26
can you enlighten me on that point do not know who could if could not said	47.65
be it understood we are speaking of	28.11
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do	43.92
monsieur artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last	116.06
he has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the	106.79
hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else warn you will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting little rest night spent in taking and dismantling	210.19
bah said beauchamp he played the prince very	17.36
it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see	155.04
lover is never terrible he	32.16
at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to	82.52
and replied very well you shall have	18.91
good at midnight my	32.89
mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or	49.33
it was horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the	63.07
disarm him only make sure of his	83.66
he had been subjected to severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded	395.04
no he merely drew pocketbook from his pocket and took from it paper folded in four and having examined it in manner almost reverential he said good have it still the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel	236.55
my lord said raoul coloring up did not wish to interrupt your highness in conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the	121.56
athos my friend and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other arms then athos looking into his friend face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord you appear as unhappy as am the	194.62
