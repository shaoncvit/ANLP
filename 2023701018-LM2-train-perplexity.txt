de tréville made sign with his hand and all retired except artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of gascon remained in his	73.45
artagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without	262.86

each stalk served as perch for grasshopper which regaled the passers by through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous	2304.34
but first interposed artagnan you must present me to madame du	177.71
never did perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing	491.11
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of man who holds the balance of life and death in his	223.49

the tocsin was	1286.74
for that reason wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against	119.06
noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered	362.89
count he inquired have you any relations no sir am alone in the	154.98
globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting strong light into my chamber and perceived with terror that man was standing within few paces of	262.87

if the poor abbé had not been in such hurry he might have had his	119.20
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented	311.04
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by dozen corpses french and	238.85
had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali	213.80

his drawing room under the regenerating influence of young wife and daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully	701.01
he determined to make two	461.48
this idea completely restored clemency to his	496.65
whilst they pursue him the king might	233.57
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker family in which he had been received as son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle	184.47

it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed	114.81
leave me command	205.67
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in sky blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his	179.65
as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in	214.97

the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their	97.73

at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing bright light on the stranger face while his own remained	132.22
but dined	1029.34
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just	282.65
monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken	99.99
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting	216.26
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the	127.16

then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with voluptuous	595.11

jacques de la	435.79
are you quite sure of that	74.57
then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that	173.94
if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to	309.63

bertuccio obeyed and despatched courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six	408.62
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always	254.76
whitsuntide it would be another	62.13

everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of man who was stranger to all human emotions excited something very like	425.38

then artagnan being alone struck light and lighted small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the	129.96
come you do not flatter	137.35
de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own	80.34
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london	187.37
and afterwards the road to châtillon	558.91
do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if did your tone is too	71.38
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy	547.19
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front	298.31
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in jealous fit had surprised her and carried her	190.77
milady felt consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her	272.94

come come cried artagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for	256.01
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said	122.13
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi arm in group of	532.35

there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which know not why appeared to me quite	355.87
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him	222.82

he recollected that there was small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the	774.71
it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what	174.35
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto	712.42
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an	300.31
all can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that	85.90
and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel carried it in my	157.93

eleven clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg	193.94
now am going to put question to you and one very much to the purpose	108.77
yes sir answered	146.00
haydée nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her	892.11
but he does wrong to use his	291.11
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly	563.07
then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation everything is possible in this affair even	271.46
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de	311.02

oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail your hand dantès adieu adieu and raising himself by final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the	228.67
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the	92.88
and yet said porthos would like to know what grimaud is	126.22
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but gross personality which he accompanied with furious	241.85
returned franz laughing in token of your	723.91
are you also the victim of treachery no said the novice but of my devotion of devotion to woman loved for whom would have laid down my life for whom would give it	179.04
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of kind	440.40
because am too young to die the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said	210.54
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin the count de villeroy and marechal de la	108.12
what godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers he had scarcely finished when artagnan made such furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last	188.31
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow	156.49
whilst all this was going on cavalier in full gallop was seen	324.23
then said she he has well played his	169.05
the epistle is laconic said artagnan and if there had not been postscript probably should not have understood it but happily there is	189.30
do not concern yourself about that we have think private room in the piazza del popolo will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress	288.32
and he gave him his	31.34
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had	202.88
the abbé rose took his hat and	105.26
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept	328.54
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their	163.99
your turn my lord said	34.32
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal	299.30
mournful answer awaited each of edmond eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had	791.07
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit	364.05
have come for nothing else but to tell you	77.59
have father who is seventy if he yet lives only love him and young girl called	514.82
cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise armilly her singing	1217.93

upon the eighth day he discerned small vessel under full sail approaching monte	768.47
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be man be strong be full of hope for am here and will watch over	311.38
if have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity	229.78
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects that is to say visit an englishwoman the one	131.59
as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their	245.84
porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his	116.52
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife chamber and found artagnan just recovering his	122.31
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on	157.55
on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each other arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count	65.71
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of devoted family but he had convinced himself by course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life	271.20
now may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is	276.50
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the	222.36
diplomat or not don know only know that he charged himself on my account with mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had been king should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had been able to offer him the golden fleece and the	197.09
that is sufficient my lord have	195.56
shall never forget it replied	71.61
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and	304.88
but feel very deeply that this fish which go and sell and with the produce of which buy the flax spin feel very keenly fernand that this is	607.60
those are kind and cheering	827.43
ah said villefort smiling confess should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with	144.25
into the service the king service mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at artagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost	191.99
as soon as the earnest money was paid artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the	262.74
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and	190.12
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by	320.08
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantès the latter of whom attracted universal	582.14
at ten clock milady began to appear	207.76
here take this continued he rapidly writing the few lines brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so no replied the count take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in	242.69

he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep	133.92
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and were	223.96
the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for moment then making an effort at self control he said and mercédès they tell me that she has disappeared disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more	235.64
you care about it then so much since they force me to wear hat of form which does not become me said gondy wish at least that the hat should be	193.62
am dead drunk that all and never did man more strongly set about getting	1172.58
because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between	325.40
but want to know in what	137.56
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows	52.38
the the dieus_ the touts les diables_ crossed one another in the	1228.59
sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you	141.61
you are jewel of man	483.48
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and	358.83
the host desired himself to serve him which artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following	348.09
so much the	65.62
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had	184.97
tony carries our	6006.18
artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman	339.23
certainly his panegyric has been	470.44
well must confess it does replied	138.74
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson	260.87
de busigny who by the by had given them magnificent dinner partner worthy of his	843.51
whom must announce to my lord duke asked	371.13
hum said	12.19
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of	222.12
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me glass of wine have already told you that we do not sell at	117.91
the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristo	206.73
it was seven clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed	66.53
how unfortunate am said she have been here six months without the shadow of	193.53
the tumult was	1399.22
oh murmured the count shall then be permitted to love again	172.56
may ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per	248.06
don you say dear artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her believe so at	65.98
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for cardinal hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and	197.04
yes will tell you all but take away the young man cannot endure his	121.53
you speak	611.99
what not asleep said felton what is she doing then she has	208.44
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with princess wished to gain little insight into the amorous adventures of his	321.79
oh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at	140.68
marriage is civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your	421.84
yes milady replied athos the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you	126.23
need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover	274.22
then seated on chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed threatening	289.51
am glad to see said artagnan that you have still that honest lad with	85.97
at nine clock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the	81.45
still more must be	126.01
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside	100.37

no you will not forget it because you are man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so	84.02
you must have discovered mine or else become	741.24

athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window having made sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the	47.88
he did as he	108.85
on then on those who love me follow me and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free free free chapter	184.30
and they would be right oh think you swore	356.06
the example of robert bruce will absolve you	2253.46
artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the	132.85
follow me said an officer who came up behind the	83.07
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against chair in corner of the room but glance from the worthy broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of	186.17
three times athos knocked without receiving an	850.83
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital	277.13
to own the truth should be inconsolable if you were to leave	262.39
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as	190.55
five minutes afterward bazin set off on full trot urging on his horse by the blows of parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of riding	209.52
ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but was so far from expecting the honor of visit that did not really recognize	112.99
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is kind of neutral beauty but of bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any	341.92

when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the	455.16

yes said the count you are right it is	35.38
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of	126.60
that is	51.80
as to artagnan he did not budge from his	83.76
he took his way toward the hôtel	36.78
sigh escaped from the mouth of	125.82
do you think so sir	73.56
planchet took place behind his master and kept at distance of ten paces from	103.61

when say one spoonful began by one now take	1132.68
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor fellow then you pity him said the	167.79
the coadjutor remained immovable and not muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like sword in returning the furious looks of the	335.78
the count has only been two or three days in paris but he already knows what fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show	88.81
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and	795.44
how in the wrong said	103.55
lord monsieur there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with modest	186.08

he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and	158.38

my lord said artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious	68.37
the road selected was continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the	383.27

while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince laid few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his highness pieces of water slipped few lines into his fish	499.94
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his	211.69
when tell you thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting	194.44
but that is the history of the hundred	37.55
ah said he hear human	211.18
porthos ran to	56.30
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked	342.52
de tréville as nine clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task knocking was heard at the street	142.44
these were pistols of an especial pattern which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own	272.14
he has he is an	183.81
athos did not even turn his	86.12
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his	153.35
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the	162.13
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us	901.47
artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in	99.57

what have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your	83.27
how so have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an	507.13
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who	180.68
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had	316.49
the three friends were likewise greatly	379.80
speak monsieur speak said artagnan who instinctively scented something	618.15
you are man of brass replied	155.38
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided character to please fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what sculptor would have chosen for chiselled	666.51
it is late and the governor is	122.58
alight planchet and inquire for confess that have scarcely courage so to	228.89
do you think it will be long before he comes in no think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten	91.24
shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror	118.88
so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were	642.29
which that which found at your feet and replaced in your	218.04
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which could not rouse	197.55

count you prolong my	1543.14
and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora monte cristo exchanged rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by	197.80
she then bowed	85.69
do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you	70.28
is the abbé at home asked	92.23
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husband	434.10
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to	222.57

it is well said he kissing it it is my master ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished	132.71
this time said artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at trot think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach	188.18
at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order let these three gentlemen	130.96
what our enemies say of us is then	550.78
but resumed la ramee that is only way of	256.91
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not	246.17
sire said the queen can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majesty wishes will be complied	78.38
the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of	261.17
saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of	237.07
his nostrils dilated like those of wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of	575.70
fools said charles do they take me for coward like themselves you have done well to warn	172.96
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as	134.75

the doctor turned	287.77
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered	581.29
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already	155.53
on honor what then is there surprising in that	315.85
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux	283.63

thanks monsieur bonacieux said artagnan emptying his glass that is all wanted of	116.88
mazarin this half humble half gallant attention went	1640.93
married if not her husband he is unquestionably her	300.66
we will arrange the matter rather	568.85
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow felton uttered cry and rushed toward	253.17

they were surrounded by crowd of people who opened way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words is the head of ali tepelini pasha of	285.81
ah said porthos what fearful day my dear artagnan what fearful day when to day we find our friends yes but under what circumstances tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be	177.32
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him present of pens paper and	880.24
cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may	246.06
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board felucca with five barrels of powder in the	237.16

athos and aramis looked at him	108.32

my sister is happily married her husband is only my brother in law that is man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless	246.48
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and	144.62
athos did not	139.11
was it ever known who this miserable fellow was he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair	313.75
understand why you accepted it and grant you my pardon but upon one	319.36

the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer	276.41
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the	179.54
he spoke the romaic language did he think	517.63
to night we stop at derby and if there is bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy	252.58
well now let us talk little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to artagnan	222.34
my dear count said he fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di	100.45
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were	315.27
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed	275.42
and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name the comte de la fere madame replied the young man	66.93
then am afraid shall very much inconvenience	388.21
you say very true responded	833.91
number and number dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in	544.42
you were walking one evening	280.60
artagnan who was known as familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	97.73
overhead could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who making the best arrangements in his power for passing comfortable night threw himself on his bed and could hear it creak and groan beneath his	294.90
shall be at your orders said monte cristo	42.60
and the young officer shook the count hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with	82.93
the two friends mounted as did their	267.49
suspected where she was	172.83
adieu or rather	1653.43
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not	103.43
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba	116.01
we must not do so	57.06
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by beacon just lighted and rock which jutted	221.50
ah sir do leave few crowns for me at the gate that may have some things am in need of it shall be done replied	128.69

the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling	671.02
pack up all you want for journey of fortnight and follow	180.48
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet and as it is not permissible to contradict queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of	210.33

here is said the englishman taking quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of francs to our house	155.84
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old	105.59
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing	289.41
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him	121.03

on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria dungeon taking thither breakfast and some	496.15
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched toward four clock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had	286.84
artagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady it was magnificent sapphire encircled with	415.56
what do you want of me he	21.52
perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on	85.29
it is no news to you added avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made sign that he entertained no doubt upon the	87.76
he felt ill at ease and at loss what to	349.55
they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful	278.81
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the	474.53

mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don try to appear anything but what you are true country youth on no account speak to her of henry	403.64
madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address last farewell to one who could thus part from	281.26
certainly not certainly not exclaimed	267.54

athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her	183.01
mordaunt made last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of	194.76

and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is	96.47
who are these gentleman three of the king	178.12
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse	186.95
she must be princess	173.97
grimaud had every quality that could attract man on duty who wishes to have	620.84
porthos knocked with his	66.85

in the first place he himself furbished sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the	287.40
franz was fascinated by the horrible	341.47

with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given	44.45
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing	1166.11
villefort smiled	5376.39

took week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there that makes three	349.17
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely	588.34
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent	343.73
spent ball not even	562.87
what consoles me said the cardinal reading the letter is that at least in this chase artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed	173.24
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five	192.37
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in	155.21
good replied aramis	327.85
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her	200.90
he recognized the influence of mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be	208.39
their vows were sacred and	1632.39

your death said he oh no you are too charming mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus have had the happiness to possess you only single	154.49
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in black coat with military collar black pantaloons and black	321.38
stay said beauchamp surely am not	158.65
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor	1310.75

because it could have been said that had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of	113.84
was not thinking of that replied madame danglars	87.58
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where mysterious providence disposes all things and out of fault nay even vice sometimes produces	664.76
yes if your majesty releases	406.05
all looked around athos himself	1822.43
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and will fetch you some	285.44
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or	258.42
mouston suggestion appear to you full of sense oh said aramis suppose the master is puritan so much the better mordioux replied artagnan if he is puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted	158.84
what is his name lord	284.57
then the heavy and collected steps of multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her	221.52
but this time the papers were mere matter of	277.56
the palais de justice communicated with the prison sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the	778.61
exactly so carriage was waiting at the end of the via	117.68
he cannot acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it	301.79
was in hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone	114.90
so then they have paid my ransom no your	196.70
then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about livres	181.01
the conversation took place in english language which artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in great	171.17
monte cristo expected burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see was	290.93
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting	455.88
you talk like noodle my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are	159.79
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood would add that believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with	382.49
at the same instant market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their	207.62
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such paroxysm of	289.13
look he	23.11
artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following	96.28
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of	42.66
and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep	95.11
there said artagnan this is capital now let me try on the dress of yonder	183.59
your pardon sir said milady with	155.21
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the	151.54
no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any	155.59
artagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to	82.53
de tréville grasped the	233.63
how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to	331.14
pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast	444.11
ah my lord said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for long	43.99
they put the stone back in its place the abbé sprinkled little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood	175.69
one day when oppressed with mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from england the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by cahusac and la houdinière strolled along the	289.69
artagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his	80.64
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of	121.52
artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the	143.01
enchanted monsieur said mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the	71.92
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to	90.75
artagnan and porthos were now alone with man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to	105.24
the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue	342.17
but how my god by mode of proceeding known to myself and by which likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal	309.75
content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and	182.66
have you any idea what became of them yes sir heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their	252.36
yes the rolling of	313.26
embrace also our good and brave	603.85
but for the sake of the mother said the	35.59
mousqueton seats and order double the bottles do you know what we are eating here said athos at the end of ten	120.71
and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and	209.60
then turning toward raoul go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de	253.03
the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so	407.72
come how shall we decide said the	182.62
soon he saw the lights of la	196.75
morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort apartments and to	111.55
all is not then over asked	291.97
have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos said the procurator	78.12
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are	418.59
ah ah you have credit with your landlord then asked	177.85
while waiting his assistance trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for	182.59
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des	152.54
in second had disinterred the box then that it might not be known had done so filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which double locked carrying off the	206.74
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting could not bear to see her	173.35
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don wish to let	107.04
communication being closed by the war was in want of	214.62
now mancini was nephew of mazarin and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the	259.39
thought the abbé busoni had told your	93.52
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	302.76
the comte de rochefort bowed like man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and	149.19
and who is with	177.37
yes said danglars darting at edmond look gleaming with	861.07
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted sort of mutiny for surrender the mayor had hanged the	672.74
my husband in the bastille cried	208.14
alas my friends	77.31
long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the	332.34
when he was only few paces from me saw that what had taken for weapon was only	182.73
knew that but supposed he had	194.16
edmond turned away his head with	85.13
tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one clock in the	265.18
well with the five minutes grace we have only ten	245.80
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw	199.17
you offered me hospitality and accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly	357.89
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf	49.01
at the sight of the	20.67
and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the	348.20
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of man who sprang lightly into his	153.84
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left space which looked ready to serve as last resting place for the	488.53
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear	127.83
it is	23.92
found my knife where had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it	309.93
that was	41.65
have promised no more than have given you teresa said luigi	335.94
this arrangement pleased every	2109.18
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had	69.09
or take care morrel lest call you	2138.53
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her	183.12
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the	190.88
you are	33.01
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive	151.42
two hours passed	299.97
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which send you now the	209.18
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in tone that faltered somewhat you alone are	180.02
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent	105.62
was it not this artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with	261.19
that will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	91.00
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	55.88
zounds cried artagnan don call him porthos nor even vallon call him de bracieux or de pierrefonds thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission	1336.09
open the	23.20
this was not enough he must now learn to	164.45
it was in this pavilion on the ground floor that artagnan and porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in manner suitable to each different	525.50
so that now continued caderousse he owns magnificent house	509.63
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert duly challenged the prince of granada and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and	795.19
porthos in order to make greater display had that evening borrowed	717.06
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of	131.57
bertuccio lay covers for	1616.10
alas they have taken everything there isn morsel of bread in the	228.08
look added	250.04
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like mummy through the bars into the room and entered	227.32
at the door he stopped to	38.98
firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of pane of glass with	549.95
yours is pretty	689.72
silence then said	210.06
scarcely was the captain breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose day and half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles	188.22
ah ah said porthos that is what you meant to say yes dear monsieur	58.11
kitty cried	115.48
madame de villefort closed the door carefully the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated	128.32
each was anxious to gain admission before the	171.98
he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honoré is not good for	135.57
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward	87.97
follow me	1214.39
thus he came along supporting himself on curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and	454.89
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel inquired the man with strong italian	233.31
no false modesty take the best horse you can	503.10
look closely the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to	350.70
perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved perhaps shall have lost all influence while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the	211.47
felton uttered	3688.40
oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they	257.26
oh no cried scarron should compromise you too	298.77
but this creature must be demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up	183.96
for what purpose upon my honor will instantly return it to	208.12
it followed that artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and	126.00
la porte	31915.19
bonacieux let us fly let us save	200.05
you are perfectly right my	57.88
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before	228.52
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to	176.16
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such	213.07
well in one of your late conversations with him you said that appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not did say	183.49
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and	83.30
there is no count of monte cristo said	30.21
do not open the pie till you are	170.46
but his temper cooled down like his friend he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about	537.02
well said the	70.56
you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will	140.59
in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to	100.87
the two lower rooms consisted of dining room with table chairs and side board of walnut and wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or	1232.20
morrel answered	273.15
but hear me continued	199.84
no don want your help watch the	317.33
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès	164.16
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the	196.23
well what are you doing count to former lackey my friend said athos he has given me news of	121.00
nothing therefore was settled that day as emery head was not steady enough for business such an	657.72
but the third time which is the present you may	131.17
never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in year the king will be of	134.95
villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means highly bred	281.10
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his joined him beauchamp did the	308.54
yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his	408.45
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of	168.65
danglars at the other and eugénie in front of	68.77
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight clock in the	98.24
ah why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned perfect stillness in the	360.23
monte cristo	20.42
himself captain	2127.45
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted	493.54
may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte	197.89
doubt if you please but am sure of what	37.64
at this moment raoul awoke without cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of	130.90
you would be the happier for it at home sire and do not doubt you would be the greater for it	130.32
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of man to be hanged but by the contemplation of man who was	105.18
mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still	140.56
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of	169.37
and you will leave me then	37.84
ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh was sure it was so the hanging of people is my	201.49
this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain moment tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and	317.77
come said artagnan let us	14.77
and now monsieur du verger he said shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the	281.52
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half	317.37
alas sir no and do not know what has become of him so that am really so unhappy that	99.77
should have been pleased to see her for like her very	97.67
at first the captain had received dantès on board with certain degree of	211.32
on the contrary think they are poor	92.65
impossible what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed	59.25
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond now if entreat if order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	166.30

she had married younger brother of the family who had left her widow with one	147.77
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his	386.60
franz the eyes repeated several times no no	393.49
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father	213.60
dantès had spoken of mercédès and villefort instantly recognized	162.99
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like	119.53
it is much more convenient at paris when anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done	198.26
ruined and what will that signify to me have not my talent left can not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune hundred or hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers and if do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should not still have that ardent love of independence which will be substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation no grieve not on my own account shall always find resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which shall be able to procure will remain my	327.72
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous	274.20
the album said edward	6917.75
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in	619.86
my misgivings had been but too	422.67
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of letter signed baronne danglars hermine de	240.38
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold	407.72
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with sigh it is you who will conduct me	177.05
stop moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my	77.91
do you suffer much asked the	127.32
besides expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to	240.59
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with	100.21
ah ah can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy said artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court	134.28
have sometimes thought as you do	287.76
you did not let the executioner escape then the executioner is still in the cellar where presume he has had an interview with mine host	259.53
ah if you could but persuade him to come out monsieur should owe you the gratitude of my whole life should adore you as my patron saint then he is there shall find him there without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining	242.60
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was man of uncommonly sound	573.56
oh oh replied artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in	199.12
mamma mamma said are we really to be killed and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and	224.11
but amid all this he perceived with feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor	156.31
but am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly	246.40
but said albert emitting volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do	1009.53
well said porthos will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight clock the rendezvous the place du palais	191.75
my lord perhaps they are not in	65.00
she thanked them both with	554.84
that is all very simple you had business in	183.60
in short why should have any more to do with the affair how did the honor or disgrace	140.01
come nearer said the magistrate with patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance owe the honor of this	133.39

grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos imminent death was likely to make him	309.96
will do it with all my heart said comminges for know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of broussel was	163.46
perhaps when all is considered you are	161.43
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of	859.00
good thought artagnan fancied it was	98.99
that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants	501.57
the young woman hid her face in her	64.76

the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him baptistin who rode in front attended the	175.43

in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to	58.48

you will then have our swords with which can assure you my friend and can play tolerably	182.40
in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante	142.38

was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into	404.91
and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by	1188.92
and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis	125.79
come artagnan don let us play sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble	443.18
he is	70.73
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous	429.63
the post chaise was happily bought three days	1500.61
there said artagnan what did tell you fortunately you won be laid up more than	183.82
but who told you was inactive but if the plot had succeeded wished it to do	248.72
project gutenberg is registered	651.77
de villefort made and returned very few	507.68
thanks artagnan thanks cried aramis almost in state of	418.15
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his	245.21

the servant entered just as he had	104.04

you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight	584.96
believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to	202.26
ah in truth madame to do that must forget the hour conversation have had with you which is indeed	314.25
the baron épinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be	204.35
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no just	1059.55

de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to	409.06

four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where vessel was	193.64
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with fine cambric pocket	1062.72
well pleasant	18571.90
egad yes but why don you come there also athos colored little and answered should go shall be delighted to see you	191.66
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when saw the procureur lift from under his mantle box two feet long and six or eight inches	464.13
me also repeated	554.26
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and	651.14
do not cast yourself against such rock he would break you like	306.92
then piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of	173.33

he sent us home in his own	133.45
he must now get his	664.13
instinctively fernand drew back his	246.80
look artagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of bradshaw gaze she has not turned	184.17
and then the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes shall soon	208.92
and this conviction restored his	679.48
cucumetto fancied for moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small sum that he cared little about	188.26
where is the treaty here it	71.81
nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong	396.56
why you will know presently pass	285.06
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family do you think father that if now should ask for company the queen would give it to me artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike blow for one party or the	200.63
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of	206.73

he might have been taken for	96.42
the deuce they do said mousqueton think should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then porthos meantime asked artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his	249.06
what has he to do at notre dame he is	536.81
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in	175.52
now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden	755.20

the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it	326.61
another and magnificent one cried the	158.77

felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or	101.15

yes let the sermon be clear said the	224.44
madame de saint méran wished her daughter should be married	80.60
they will be ten times worse off in	403.07

they may give him the honors of the	74.04
this must be impossible it would seem so but listen and you will	121.33
arrived an hour	242.15
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his	310.51
stake your diamond	257.31
know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own	401.20
but aramis was	756.25

edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and mist passed over his	263.52
god be praised and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still	137.24
dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt	208.91
poor man he is worthy	274.96
de blacas will go and find my	237.09
my friend said aramis with look of imbecility on his face which artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if did not come from heaven at least was leaving paradise which is almost the	111.21
foi he said prefer waiting till	789.27
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive person who saw her for the first	198.61
the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux that he was fifty one years old retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs	842.08
along the isle of	217.57

it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry	99.20
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection	122.86
when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the	241.19
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal decision let there be if you please reference to the king	157.22

at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out	118.72
there is way of detecting its	661.61
now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your	402.39
twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with	651.59
mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him	189.02
arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator door then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was	117.28
the gate groaned on its hinges and artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the	358.51

well the poison brings on cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very	391.07

lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other	87.28
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his	499.37
artagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited	259.32
can it be otherwise bought my experience dearly particularly fair	2347.90
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in	107.96

the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his	120.75
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the	259.73
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future	66.43

oh you are an angel exclaimed the young	48.72
well then said mordaunt choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself	205.77

it is the first time he has ever been in	33.29
he is think the son of general épinay he	170.93
de villefort was powerful protector to his enemies he was silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was statue of the law made	155.84
the comb was to be leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing	626.94
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very	182.64

athos followed comminges without saying single	611.58
what is offered from generous heart should be accepted	988.61
by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some	261.90
and too exclaimed the young man in transport of	125.33

amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the	102.04
but it is the wretched that man cannot injure me haydée said monte cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to	80.35
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my	129.59
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his	337.31
as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by second then third at the fourth the count knew what to	315.43
let them take my fortune am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and	118.91
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it and hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugénie	187.65
he knew this was the last	202.03
well what the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man ask you if you recognize him that man wait	128.22
did not look on caderousse as bad man and thought him incapable of committing crime or even	427.54
truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur de nargonne was baron and my name is	219.22
the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those musketeers_ those he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those added he glancing at me with his tiger cat eye had made riot in the rue férou in cabaret and that party of his guards thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters you must know something about	242.49
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of	189.65
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with	225.12
now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to	178.75
cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on	589.98
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed	122.39
what are they your excellency what became of this little boy for think you told me it was	131.28
le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted	838.91
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son room and inquired from laporte if the king was in	94.95
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred	176.68
having poured out the soup the turnkey	449.18
indeed said the	26.58
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people	751.02
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five	139.51
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe do not think it would be out of keeping even at this	117.20
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage	88.39
have never before been at paris and it is the first time have ever even set my foot in	108.37
everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to	184.77
heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor	952.40
épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished	120.07
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was	178.72
athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the	361.23
come when he will it shall be kept for	68.07
artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him	121.50
artagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young man death would be placed to the account of the	67.54
giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took albert	178.58
end of the port wine	377.34
but did you not say that my kind grandfather precaution had neutralized the poison yes but not against strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity	383.41
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo table and that of signor	121.96
gramercy who would ever have thought it artagnan only	297.60
was going when he was	171.33
now said planchet let us bind him to	123.82
you then served louis	2857.15
the usurper converted decidedly my dear	1513.33
no am	402.97
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing	315.46
toward six	240.87
know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in saloon where was showed ring which he said he had received from	178.17
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with calm and melancholy look he whispered am am and his almost closed lips uttered name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear	288.24
volume four	1688.19
it was	203.12
do you promise swear to you	61.81
immediately the window was opened and ladder of rope was let down from	263.18
can you recollect all that perfectly	281.50
the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern	280.00
can understand that said	53.30
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry	279.77
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such point maternal love or rather	225.95
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands	155.28
bonacieux was the very life of	88.60
this he said to planchet must be the archbishop chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville but the convent where is that the convent your honor is at the other end of the village know it	126.82
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon	149.36

de blacas if it only be to reassure faithful servant will your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphiné trusty men who will bring you back faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces surdis_ replied the king continuing the annotations in his	623.74
no not tomorrow morning if you please but	292.56

debray do wish to know him do wish to know that he gives advice do wish to follow it do speculate no you do all this	222.08
have the purse still by me large one made of red	616.83
let me at least reach shady spot said	386.14
she is not the less guilty monsieur duke the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her	205.48
artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward	118.66
you have seen the count you say have only just left	58.98
bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his	124.91
oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the	206.43
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as	264.77
but why into five parts asked caderousse you only mentioned four	700.66
mordaunt went away with the	54.76
go on my child said the count in the romaic	59.56
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen	159.85
you are of so superior mind nothing escapes	723.40
sir since you command the cavalry pardon me am commander in	520.79
the lackeys were brought by the cries she	158.29
now listen to me maximilian if by artifice by entreaty by accident in short if by any means can delay this marriage will you wait yes promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before magistrate or priest you will	211.92
not without my defending it said	458.48
except your signature and your	397.35
you do then obey someone yes	1139.99
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in charming little book of hours bound in blue	523.16
oh gentlemen said the host have been	52.19
proceed she	68.65
good said the sentry you may now go	82.98
the abbess who was the daughter of noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies	217.44
have proof of	165.83
the two friends exchanged smile of	383.64
she called the maid and questioned	223.06
at half past seven the retreat was	600.82
true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused	317.23
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the	85.05
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his	114.40
him to whom your excellency pays that little	395.08
was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you acted in opposition to my	169.30
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the	303.63
thought was right in believing that cavalcanti to be stingy	419.48
that is when have lighted the match will undertake	414.83
do you know him thought recognized him and was not	106.68
well would secure for myself fortune independent of him even if acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to	590.23
do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept	152.41
open the gate he	132.25
as soon as she was gone noirtier made sign to morrel to take the	111.31
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing covering of black	608.60
well said interrupted château renaud and pray that if you should ever be in similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for	108.34
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded	49.12
no he went out early this morning replied the	148.02
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the	99.64
why this is victory cried the king all radiant complete victory yes sire as complete as that of the bridge of	330.83
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with	168.24

was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of scene on the	250.79
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under artagnan arm entered and broke mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring	278.10
athos and artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the	170.66
let me die that is	72.09
bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when cab stopped at the door and depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its	198.82
and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went	142.25
this was in fact custom familiar to	223.00
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by jove don be coward or shall cut off your	453.49
in few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting	391.51
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of	530.00
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the	116.95
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against	504.45
signor pastrini came to the door to receive his	98.66
maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated it maximilian has he then owned all to you	262.54
but let us see whatever may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to	280.98
in an instant they found themselves in little harbor formed in natural creek the boat grounded on the fine	463.73
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother demand justice upon you and swear that if it be not granted to me will execute it	204.66
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris manuscript in folio endorsed or we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis	343.78
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which deign to charge you and on that condition pardon everything forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him restore my	259.83
suppose am free to say or not to say who am to two strangers who take fancy to ask	129.33
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme	1100.82
on the eve of departure carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me	171.84
and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to	52.82
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for	884.23
and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one	277.77
oh my god murmured	119.48
you see now why did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions could not thank him for what he has	95.51
then he is not dead no you see plainly he is not	88.29
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of	228.56
are there any others yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the	412.56
morrel again changed	6626.57
another queen in want of	316.16
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurator wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to	133.01
well then can just suit	330.42
the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of	72.52
may reckon on you as an auxiliary artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to	286.64
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his	235.23
with forty five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six months you with your music and with my voice we shall double our	233.60
before die must not forget that have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to	401.09
willingly said the cardinal will even ask the count to keep it for my	64.28
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to	93.49
gaetano was not	57.55
the latter faithful to the principle of horace admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were	639.15
because nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the	213.72
come come thought artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in good	294.17
many small donations to are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the	1183.69
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers	215.47
you see said he calling artagnan attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau an hour walk we have made tour of my	142.42
unless copyright notice is	5041.25
such are for royalty and we are simple	522.78
leave me then to act and have no fears for the	119.33
yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child	161.16
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond	294.32
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux	723.80
his face was pale and drawn like that of man who had just undergone some inward	180.25
yes but those five millions and half are not mine and are only proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and half belong to them at any other time should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses have recently sustained are well known and as told you my credit is rather	211.72

my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as live shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you am indebted even for my	166.19
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days have received them shall be in	60.63

cavalcanti to meet your lost	561.70
go up said the host she is still in her	58.32
ah said the count see	20.83
speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted	282.62
albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his	133.56
dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes but as we know artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own	209.56
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and	861.62
the became general but strength was on the side of the	122.54
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good then he said aloud listen morrel see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your	215.32
ah said the	14.20
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the	115.19
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her	466.97
in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in few	463.50
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the	181.50
why then are you about to betray it to me because as said without you can do nothing and am afraid you will refuse me the favor come to ask if you do not know to what end ask	98.30
at the lesser gate of the castle he posted	209.76
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still	50.95
what is his folly he fancies he possesses an immense	795.48
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha exactly	552.60
but you say you do not wish to kill me	25.53
furnished myself with	363.38

my friend think that he is much troubled with	213.84
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost scene at the	167.27
let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brother thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than had	313.50
the carriage pursued its way still going at great pace till it dashed into paris and	586.13
we came merely to inquire your health and to take your	160.91
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by	1179.82
what you have been to sea yes have just made little excursion to the borromean	283.22
artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their	230.33
avrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his	133.57
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that now bear the	122.17
that agreed said	167.40
and louis	12738.80
friends said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood no replied artagnan regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each	205.95
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for	210.22
you mean then that if leave you haydée should die yes my	144.46
one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless	257.38
what is his name major	519.16
passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to	111.57
be sure shall not fail to do so returned the count	112.99
if you are in haste monsieur said artagnan with the same simplicity with which moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself pray	106.42
yes he appears to be resolute	205.02
as you will	123.88
ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the	202.87
each one went out by the open	132.26
friend he cried feel that am dying thanks he made last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside	242.90
do you know that am growing old am nearly thirty	235.21
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly	158.69
all can say is continued the countess taking up the and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for while and revisit this earth of ours than anything	330.68

well then	222.60
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered	214.15
you are sure of it	25.24
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach	103.02

danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his	155.77
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect	215.97

slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon	381.01
caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and	161.26

scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed him like bloodhound on full	210.67
artagnan opened the door and called out to waiter to desire madeleine to come	233.51
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found table to support his clenched	203.72
well then off to the nearest goldsmith and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from	240.83
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand	245.85
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in	269.32
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the	339.11
the rendezvous artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no	156.23

and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage not out of my armory for at terracina was plundered even of my hunting	774.37
there was no time to	32.50
artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse	144.95
on the day the morrow by eleven clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he	170.69
alas do not madame rejoined	251.66
if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is derived from texts not protected	298.49
the footman obeyed his	1041.82
yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at	39.77
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated	560.16
athos made sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he	57.00
well can see porthos certainly	230.42
not at	110.51
he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as	158.12

the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose firm	498.65
but can he understand you	127.21
all is	407.45
my dear dantès said he swear to perform what am going to tell you for it is matter of the deepest	63.01
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy	745.89
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your	154.54
now as artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him	142.37
yes understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound	472.08
suppose were soldier like you and ordered to carry certain redoubt and you knew must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my	184.66
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated	177.58
villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into	126.83
do you think athos will be sorry to see us oh cried porthos oh	80.36
don let us disarrange your	170.79
humph thought that looks like my handiwork fancy must have mended that skull somewhere or	1152.41
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letter donned his dress suit drew on pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to	388.53

monsieur du vallon commend his eminence to your	230.04
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent rendering such service madame replied artagnan have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty service and that shall only be happy the day lose it for	113.40
we must understand each other said the	42.05
the king was few steps behind me when suddenly saw something rise up in front of me like huge	336.89
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered	154.97
he added that he did not know	50.71
debray conveyed the count reply to the	126.97
fire cried grimaud	1687.31
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open	284.58
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the	124.30
not with us sir replied	126.92
then you will be	100.05
give him to	14.76
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see	99.80
but artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not	343.28

does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry	174.47
you are acquainted with the scriptures artagnan thought of the appointment	134.80

at this moment the coadjutor was announced cry of surprise ran through the royal	141.29
that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de	226.61
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment third time but by this time pistache patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his	137.14
do better than that sir save	225.47
ah ah have you finished grimaud grimaud made sign in the affirmative and pointed to dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque	227.99
no but tell me it is question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to	187.87
artagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing meeting gold chain or	456.64
come hither yes	2801.23
the tutor followed	520.27
some highlanders were listlessly keeping	10393.73
these two letters are the only ones ever wrote to	250.01
here said milady placing bag full of louis in felton	324.46
the street was laid out name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of	209.95

the cardinal seemed	1041.92
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite	415.30
you may see matters differently artagnan and think	928.42

come and roll me to	176.64
think hear noise she said leave	493.14
but what shall you do with him with whom with	113.00
artagnan who was by nature very curious as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue did all he could to make out who athos porthos and aramis really were for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name athos in particular who league away savored of	472.35
artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by which he	376.91
de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the	39.77
tis more than possible answered the comte de la	36.85
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress but milady started up pushing her	220.69
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable may consider myself almost as condemned man said artagnan shaking his	135.49
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not want of courage which rendered her poverty	308.25
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was	153.57
good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said	102.36
maximilian and emmanuel looked at each	76.36
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their	193.90
it is possible haydée that so perfect seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in	356.83
we want first to put our prisoners in place of safety replied	183.41
these proceedings made artagnan and porthos draw	430.83
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same	28.81
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and silk	581.61
your very devoted husband baron	2100.90
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed	220.81

caderousse plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas ideas were but the germ the plan was	438.96
can see nothing but his back resumed	348.52
formerly brewer replied the	218.74
it will be work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin will finish by shouting out down with all the people have mentioned each in his	249.41
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply measure of self	423.56

my officer said athos has forgotten to give piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his	170.15
informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king	61.55
some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of	580.83
well then said athos what are your schemes what do you propose zounds nothing more than	159.94
if you absolutely	1129.83
am more your friend than you think for our very first encounter could by saying word to the cardinal have had your throat cut they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any	379.43
there was postscript write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his	311.02
and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his	34.53
the count wished to speak but gush of blood stifled	211.85
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange	156.43
fine name said	106.69
grimaud drew near and kissed it	371.26

the woman followed him and lord de winter did not	47.89
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of man conscious that they are	227.88
man on whom we can depend	367.29
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your	168.20
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was	142.06
pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their	751.11
having reached the summit of his vengeance by long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before	239.94
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to	85.08
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said	260.86
to join the army under the prince	266.95
rochefort he exclaimed you is it you indeed am not mistaken artagnan cried	176.80
of what use is it to be churchman pray you do not avoid going to war by that means you see the cardinal is about to make the next campaign helm on head and partisan in	156.53
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the	84.40
let me see have not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had miraculous escape forget how but know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it his return from	335.28
friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead	98.03
but the prince de marsillac yes indeed that the right	245.08
de villefort asked the	22.90

indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world artagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not	191.90
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is	283.87
it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis	156.50
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of	156.53

superhuman joy expanded the old man eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite	251.67

he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of treasures was he awake or was it but dream was it transient vision or was he face to face with reality he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and	216.47
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and should run	91.91

the outlook was	1772.83

artagnan obeyed like child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in	262.71

on the staircase he met signor	231.53
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish	510.58
morrel here is the without	286.77
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his	211.85
at first they saw nothing around	225.77
athos at the same moment moved by similar impulse looked back	304.14
it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or is there any crime in this request no	120.98
not to me hope no not to you so am going to tell you where he	49.18
the silence however could not last	611.40
it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission will find you better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at	401.04
so if do not send you more it is because fear you would not accept larger	229.71

suddenly man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence yield you yield to me do you not giant had seized also aramis two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable	303.28
you are the king servant and must go wherever that service calls	227.10
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young	241.87
if can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all	538.56
lord de winter on quitting artagnan gave him his sister	227.76
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the	77.92
was then obliged to come back	83.08
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other	217.06
when we show friend city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out woman whose lover we have	470.77

oh that different thing yes know there are traditions of that sort said	271.95

he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of	142.76
you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to	86.68
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was	122.10
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let woman terrify you so and what does it amount to all to be	174.04
at this movement which nobody opposed he resumed little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the	227.25

he wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce	86.76

his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button	361.47

franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards	177.60

but how tell me at least the	90.33
gracious heavens exclaimed dantès what is the matter what has happened quick quick returned the abbé listen to what have to	169.45

it is at least consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are	183.00
go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued your	171.36
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which have been patiently listening for the last half	101.94
you have not played for long time said you ought then to have good	105.86
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded	203.89
for moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal	235.58
she opened the	38.95
but whither shall we fly whither escape let us first withdraw from this house afterward we shall	427.91
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian language he as provençal perfectly	471.89
you all know that had the fancy of going to	221.35

she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number and he undertook to call and take artagnan with him in order to introduce	207.09
madame said artagnan rising have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my	99.64
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was	181.35
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for	39.29
morcerf repeated	1023.48
the next morning when artagnan entered aramis chamber he found him at the	73.17
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his	219.79
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his	145.71
see what good fortune brought you said morrel when he was alone with the	78.94
but tell me said andrea am to remain bareheaded pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown	221.21
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur artagnan replied athos is in the service he is soldier and obeys all constitutional	117.37
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint	99.45
ah so much the better feared this little precaution might have been	133.75
that shall be testified to rest	461.92
and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him to be sure the coadjutor has	92.88
is it my equipment yes and no replied	218.87
pardon you said he the ill you have done	44.24
wanted discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting	167.00
imagined it must be said	41.34
but the comte de la fere asked the	14.46
oh dieu said monte cristo and have forgotten my smelling bottle have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on	159.90
well speak if it depends on	308.71
oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how talk to	129.54
and about to become the husband of young and lovely girl	260.99
he took hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred	146.11
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last	153.28
oh were not foreigner were but frenchman were but of gentle birth the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his	436.63
one opposite to me the other with his back to	96.38

monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of	91.32
run and seek athos porthos and	167.25
at quarter to six clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal	232.52
there was moment silence then the carriage cleared the	273.50
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by but as against the side of this pony rattled sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the	468.66
what for the emperor return the emperor is no longer on the throne then he abdicated at fontainebleau in and was sent to the island of	140.66
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their	399.39
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been	241.67

on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our	1071.73

dantès waited expecting question but in	1503.00
on the ground floor dining room two drawing rooms billiard room staircase in the hall and little back	619.18
signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justice he had had great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend	115.93
that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into	486.00
rochefort extended his hand to artagnan who took	44.40
from the ends of these two wings extended the	207.27
what said kitty	906.52
only ask	28112.46
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate	115.22
yes since she	906.52
next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess rank that of candidly acknowledging	540.55
scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping	654.75
supported myself by chair feeling that was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	251.48
lieutenant asked	160.78

the young woman in the street replied by single tap and the shutter was opened little	182.03

the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of fault having been	293.27
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly	798.02
avrigny listen noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his	179.89

he saw little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing sword and firing pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his	389.50
he was wealthy once perhaps said the	318.10
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so	478.42
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than	77.83

nevertheless rapid as the movement had been artagnan had had time to get glimpse of the head of an old	109.03
in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was	139.45
cardinal must have the queen	269.05
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing	429.69
well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than am for you forget there is little quarrel to arrange between us	132.41
the abbé lowered the	506.78
the jeweller meanwhile was humming song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid	415.72
what then why then they would be laughed at and master pastrycook must never be laughed	272.72
those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of	371.46
he wore large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed	644.07
that is	29.45
he is very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks	223.43
but how asked	176.95

he received yesterday message from the prince de condé he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not	228.46
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for	203.46
let us talk of something else said	68.46
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die oh entreat you exclaimed morrel in low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my	108.83

flurry in stocks some days this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary	192.43
grimaud obeyed without	2328.94
oh also swear it monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his	81.37
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he	130.32

he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent	354.80
the child went directly to him without kissing his	226.01

how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by	355.59
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his	169.64
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless	284.60
monsieur said he as long as hold him in this manner he can cry ll be bound but as soon as let go he will howl	182.87
soon as kitty left him artagnan directed his steps toward the rue	253.51
he is saved he is saved cried dantès in paroxysm of	187.43

yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by	180.06

in the avenue des champs	979.33
ah no madame that could not	61.89
admire all that is beautiful returned the young	131.92
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that did not sooner assist you in your	203.10
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for had seen you aramis with the king and you count knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered	193.03
oh inquired him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night	198.69

this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain	397.87
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling	256.19
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying musket with fixed bayonet followed	301.67

well then should say for instance resumed danglars that if voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king procureur as bonapartist agent will denounce him exclaimed the young man	154.69
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your duty selim is dead replied voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from	193.69

the stranger met julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for	106.06
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed	203.38
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked	71.60
that the whole	287.83
he is gone to	139.90
but consider artagnan added he in tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to woman who wherever she goes brings misery with	285.24
relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wife story to see if the two recitals	189.45
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he	440.83
it was empty as yet but pheasant and two partridges were lying near	304.05
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and	1155.16
thereupon he returned in lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to	114.63
pardon me and then tell me how can risk my life to serve your grace you are brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to artagnan who pressed it	81.55

at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside cavalier richly dressed was close to the	89.62
come on then said athos for unless am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to	104.58
rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young	486.48

danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count	104.25

as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took glance into the	158.39
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons	95.99
there on turning round artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had	129.32
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of	219.07
well monsieur asked	71.84
well exactly like me have just killed man whose face is not unknown to	114.42
thank you for the compliment my young friend replied aramis we can see from whom you learned	152.52
anne of austria at the age of forty	79.79
that great man who was so revered by artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked	237.57
where do you wish to be taken asked the	23.77
villefort had only just given utterance to few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter all the disclosures which were made this	217.86
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided see you again all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity but tell me what woman has lover more truly in love what queen servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more	256.42
country clown said anne of austria people will	189.41
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as	414.46
it was continual scratching as if made by huge claw powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the	1315.96
the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse am rather	159.22
and he said feel that my place is not in the judge seat but on the prisoner	183.63

my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who	158.20
ah thought artagnan the man am warned against by	314.09
two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity	409.70
what vessel is that asked	150.28
ah my god whispered	514.92
my dear artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your	95.15

yes if you think existence worth anything to man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you	170.09
come let be merciful to every sinner besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be better time than the	168.56
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied	1057.21
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for	139.22
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine	93.41
the woman looked up at these words and with glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued	160.72
back already what can have happened then to bragelonne let him enter cried artagnan let him come	127.82

you are wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of	55.23
he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn	193.53
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was	182.94
he no longer feared realities but	1666.62

monseigneur see well that must call	463.20
the two musketeers met at the	63.30
it goes without saying that when he saw huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy	144.27

it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de	116.88
mistrust everything in short even your own	578.52
what appears to you to emanate from celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less	439.37
he could not understand how albert fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this	213.18
the coadjutor returned to parliament more monarch than king queen and cardinal all three	808.89
was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur	75.21
qui vive he	715.64
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by general	164.37

porthos had received thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his	218.52
he listened to know whence this sound could	438.01
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from artagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his	134.13

then on his return give him that card and this sealed	438.37
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the	258.21
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious	204.96
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward	76.97

the count who perceived	43.45
he left the	439.07
why did you not say all this before you took action sir she	117.63
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of glance why this lost kiss if on the other side it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known his three companions joined	284.31
do you not form very rash judgment emmanuel said	652.74
that better cried the abbé now we are on the right	125.32
take care you are going to immure traveller sinbad the sailor man who comes to see paris you are going to make patriarch of	137.51
the king pointed this	490.80
the fact is said artagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves	501.67
true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust poor edward is as	143.52

now thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was	177.98
my lord observes that there will be enough to go	139.65
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another	176.13

noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be	157.84
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his	194.31
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than	120.23

ah said mazarin breathing more	696.60
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigue all together exalted his mind above human	480.87
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to	48.13

now at the moment when left his house here aramis	151.11
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from	237.59

he therefore told him	109.21
the history is sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it	145.93
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be	437.19

he thought himself in sepulchre into which ray of sunlight in pity scarcely	835.84
and suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating	224.90

this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it	246.82
it was sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely	566.46
noirtier closed his	93.60
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint	188.74

while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have	213.29
you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings	373.74
do not remember if it is exactly francs which am still owing him but dare say we shall not dispute the	230.49
you are noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed	229.69
the iron made no impression but met with smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was	367.71
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it	138.37
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the	167.41
and you have seen him he has just left	39.37
know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one	214.53
federal laws and your state	980.43
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound	218.72
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo	100.94
noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my	248.52
not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for man is above that sort of thing oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with smile and shake of the	85.47

ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau	188.97
he is fine young man of fair complexion little too fair perhaps pleasing in manners but you will see and judge for	313.24
your hand athos and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of	152.99
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power he hated and adored her at the same	261.88
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment pistol from his	341.80
it might be vengeance of milady that was most	163.01
and what crime has he committed he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte	93.46
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is god who will punish	161.81
but as regards the letter of advice am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money	228.54
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped	73.30
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied	169.31
ah monsieur planchet began to	235.45
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli	428.11
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross knee	829.09
oh shall then again become fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered believer in providence and all this all this because my heart which thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by woman	344.47
say there is no need why dantès should die it would indeed be pity he	165.88
what noise about musketeer would arrest ten of them hundred even all the company and would not allow	629.68
well such things have	162.18
aramis made presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her	153.09
shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	235.08
if his heart is free and he will marry haydée the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom have brought up with the love of father and who has shown the love and tenderness of daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last	161.91
and if you should hear of anything very scandalous will communicate it to	204.68
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the	49.98

in fact he could say these two children of cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have	339.98
who told you that loved him asked milady	219.61
oh look at me continued she with feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old	278.58
your having sent for me is another proof of your	184.58
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs will accompany	127.68
but what can do for you then artagnan	65.97
father you have heard speak of certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques	167.59
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended volume of smoke increasing as it	209.55
the judges were looking for new outbreak from the	691.34
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his	179.30
he returned to his room and depositing the ring in casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through	329.37
silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked	222.18
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent	315.98
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of	88.44
bonacieux help then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with sobbing cry pressed her lips to	112.50
edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as jeune amélie_ had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to	236.54
athos drew sharp poniard from his belt and cut the	350.22
all the rest of the square was paved with	135.59
artagnan at once comprehended that this was his	254.33
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by subterraneous passage to another	440.25
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur	24.67
then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil oh do you then know him cried julie whose eyes sparkled with	286.37
never never returned to the country where she	111.11
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of buckingham was written there at full	74.65
bazin became lay	3852.65
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new	329.87
you have not seen all yet continued faria for did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding	168.02
de la trémouille but warn you that am well informed and all the fault is with your	137.45
good all right said voice almost lost in the	321.18
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say	208.58
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so	182.98
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the	90.10
the young man waited in comparative darkness and	244.09
what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe patience monsieur everything will come in its	319.76
and madame de saint méran have died that is	74.22
yes really sir you were in fact medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the	151.69
know that ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if do shall learn nothing	318.13
andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious	177.08
she listened at eugénie door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in	286.42
franz took his hat and went away in	78.60
molière had not written his scene in avare	316.62
vampa looked at albert with kind of admiration he was not insensible to such proof of	81.21
this paper my friend said faria may now avow to you since have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to	223.65
shall expect you returned morrel and will pay you or shall be	122.91
how absurd as if one crown were not as good as	251.05
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in	235.13
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the	35.77
may you not have been philandering little also monsieur bonacieux oh the devil that unpardonable in man of your age and who besides has such pretty wife as	221.70
then turning to athos he added seem to miss something	288.19
the coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by athos raoul and	528.32
alas yes murmured de	73.52
woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself wouldn give farthing for his	146.24
was now safe for could swim along the ditch without being seen and reached the canal in	471.29
we need not say she stopped at the first	110.48
she was said to have weak chest and like antonia in the violin_ she would die one day while	349.07
it is not wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all	326.43
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your	316.16
the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of	102.93
you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me should not have believed	77.48
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be	79.20
and you have lost it how stupid yes but by careful search it might be	287.85
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full	213.82
but can never escape said artagnan with such	123.40
so the matter ended for the abbé	181.22
am not one of those tyrants who detain women by	497.45
athos alone remained seated calm and	797.18
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its	163.51
but don let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your master	410.58
reflect that am your wife you are	152.99
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out	166.43
where forbidden asked	2230.98
tell them yourself that was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of	207.80
smiling is thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the	247.61
the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this	95.67
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that ought to have no secret from	114.13
oh not the least in the world madame my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in	189.58
are you not going to morrow morning at six clock louis to bathe at conflans think you wished to do so of your own accord you are right madame said the king and am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed	92.15
what is the king doing they	90.87
you have evidently seen and observed	251.93
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him	117.09
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be	190.80
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six	158.15
silence then cried	55.51
the jailer therefore only	1822.20
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between	217.68
monsieur she said do not understand	37.99
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked	338.14
adapt your promises to their respective	1280.53
it is rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the	183.19
well continued	137.48
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their	647.66
are you not alone asked vampa with	126.23
but where is athos now cried	95.97
come we have not any time to lose it is half past twelve let us set	112.12
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and	446.52
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him pistole tell me what you have seen and will pledge you the word of gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my	98.18
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and	714.69
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without	386.83
that pity said athos	659.04
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony thousand	814.83
monsieur he said moment they tell me great things of	104.50
be satisfied will deny	553.41
let me know my crime and the reason why was	174.95
let go and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly	436.93
oh wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse	201.77
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their	234.15
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her	301.71
anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king ear say something gracious to monsieur artagnan my	241.65
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti when will it take place on	302.65
he wished bernajoux speedy convalescence took leave	4007.42
hush said artagnan the some one is	128.63
edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside	279.60
do you know saint mandrier	467.70
madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so	138.30
this was albert favorite lounging	2853.89
divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to	338.74
it is important that none of your crew should see	114.36
and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious	183.20
during this time madame morrel had told her son	78.98
it was no longer rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently	166.48
the brand disappeared the beauty alone	1588.35
say we have been here eighty three	134.70
artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into artagnan breast crying one for you and one for me the best for last cried artagnan furious nailing him to the earth with fourth thrust through his	150.91
then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life shall see you every	95.31
so much the	65.62
he took quill wrote the name of artagnan in the commission and returned it to	115.73
but who is oh remember said	221.73
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own	47.13
sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among	338.17
at ten minutes past five albert entered	988.66
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the	101.97
look here resumed artagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de	196.22
ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the and if he can send us an account of the	93.01
shall not find amongst them such great hearts as	428.56
andrea think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man was born for	250.82
and yet said artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must	52.66
buy those horses he said to the	153.73
hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed	962.67
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that thank her for the present that she made me of	114.77
planchet went and presented himself as lackey out of place who was in search of	182.16
now gascons are always poor are they not sire can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your	363.49
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come	71.92
shall take any arms for what purpose any money it is	222.00
yes yes he murmured am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf	85.33
oh what magnificent jewel cried the astonished	610.59
impossible said louvieres sir beware of driving us to	816.71
and madame danglars	388.90
yes said aramis	67.12
aramis continued and yet while do belong to the earth wish to speak of you of our	139.26
then forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the	128.52
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your	244.81
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed know not but one evening about five clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen detachment of custom house officers advancing in our	514.79
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at	129.69
handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not my faith said the young man laughing confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as see there is no concealing anything from	172.69
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of chained up dog went up to the	120.89
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may hope you may not only hope said danglars but consider it settled thing if no obstacle arises on your	170.03
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed sentiment resembling ferocity animated her	563.66
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for messenger to send to	79.33
in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty	209.50
bonacieux shrugging her	814.61
at midnight my dear monsieur	395.48
but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves no no be easy on that score the family is	628.36
the story sent you from	703.60
oh not word said she in concentrated voice not word of all that have said to you to this man or am lost and it would be you you then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to felton	188.20
then you came here to defend him him whom the man we are	125.96
at the bottom of his heart he had often had feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his	186.69
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced	154.66
permit me madame to express my surprise said the	146.34
the circumstances that had hastened the return of artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the	227.86
monsieur de chavigny where was he	135.91
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir then shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be worthy son of such	99.33
what are you looking at asked	66.56
but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother last moments never you are right said morrel	339.61
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all	745.05
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ball that which contained the	64.29
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice week and he was now availing himself of that	220.30
and am very glad you recognize me	195.76
do not feel remorse because that woman profoundly hold deserved her	1125.14
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps that health which excellent my dear friend better than	146.16
nevertheless or find some one else continued artagnan turning his	202.99
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the	134.05
yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the	101.44

well what is it what is going on here said he in jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go	91.55
this fresh allusion to byron drew smile to franz countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such man as the mysterious personage before	232.84
recollect our only desire is to carry out in fitting manner the last wishes of our	270.49
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little	226.21
you know his business here	286.98
my only fear is the chance of dantès being	345.83
and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our	450.83

indeed you give me more credit than deserve only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is	73.56

you will leave france you will return to england will swear to	64.94
we have already observed with what rapidity artagnan seized the expression of	190.02
the eyes of noirtier glistened and avrigny	346.13
artagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her	143.13
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers	120.33

bonacieux addressing this epithet to her	409.02
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via	138.23
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two	393.34

by the light of lamp he saw woman wrapped in dark mantle seated upon stool near dying	533.31
madame bonacieux murmured	168.35

my words have not convinced	226.19
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify	193.73
and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of	119.58
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as prisoner to judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to	192.66
bonacieux but without being able to make step glued as she was to the spot by	137.92
ah said cavalcanti to himself if only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed	327.00

franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency strong mind always acquires over mind less	783.52
the count stopped on seeing the young	34.43

like those unfortunate persons endowed with fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she	1174.30
are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for moment	264.58
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from	98.50
the road to	977.25

the host drew back and burst into	178.52
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with smile of disdain on his	145.38
shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question	74.39
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf turn analogous to the persons if not to the	237.83

the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his	111.56
and the best hack	2687.86
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier said	450.83
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death	98.68
and the	330.19
whilst this scene was going on artagnan remained with open mouth and confused	256.13
swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him will fall upon	63.39
sblood he escapes	1077.10
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the	298.17
porthos however found that he had no straw left for	145.09
my adored valentine words cannot express one half of my	1059.31
then you were going to rueil yes have despatch from the prince to his	107.17
do you hear it it is running	92.16
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the	132.27
and in the middle of deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm	265.58
apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier herblay now the abbé herblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal	195.29
by his advice decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the	435.95
why do you say so because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave	104.23
meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different	238.69
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of	186.39
will however inform monsieur artagnan of your arrival	367.08
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common	159.88
he went the first time to save the honor of great queen the second to avert the death of great	129.76
well what did he say then that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day and then he added in low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this	88.45
and they walked on	374.64
milady was there as it were where you	164.67
great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been	72.43
no hermine replied debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the	81.37
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by lamp which threw its light over all that part of the	186.02
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things warn you shall not believe	110.71
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like man in	357.91
noirtier eye continued to say	580.41
what matter you know take but little sleep and do not suppose you are very much inclined for it	149.03
is he accompanied yes by lackey named	1499.07
yes replied	94.58
do not know he is no longer in my hands replied	35.28
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have	187.16
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend	122.53
about five minutes replied the	65.40
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young	194.29
silence child hush we are flying did not	607.20
immediately brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last	182.62
bazin my friend said aramis believe you meddle with my	68.64
where are you going asked	59.06
on his right and left	139.00
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for	185.77
procurator dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator	173.55
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete	12944.03
my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant	142.14
the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of	221.77
took wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for piece of paper my match box being empty with which proposed to get light from the small flame still playing on the	368.12
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three artagnans with two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other	226.27
come come continued the count see you are still the same an	93.33
so much the better for him he will suffer less said the	104.34
there was an energy conviction and sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the	166.07
at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed	144.49
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp	271.25
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic	599.50
am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis but if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul	150.71
meanwhile what are you going to do yes	31.43
he led the way toward the hill of saint	217.32
to be great chemist in the east one must direct chance and this is to be	230.20
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw	212.05
will say two words about it to the cardinal esquire	296.61
you villain will you finish cried artagnan athos what has become of athos while fighting and retreating as have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself	201.57
it was about four clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the	77.01
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is	212.46
and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his	243.28
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by back gate ran to neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there horse and continued with loose rein his journey to	361.40

and what are they first thrust with the coadjutor whom met last night at madame de rambouillet and whom found particular in his remarks respecting	313.05
well asked he what now is there any difficulty in the way	113.60
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed	193.41
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my	206.01
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had	182.77
and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have	114.16
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like artagnan came from behind cloud and by her light artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de	281.95
in ten minutes artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were	316.25
none of her women accompanied her only donna	570.70
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the	298.83
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of	267.02
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road	73.10
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with	317.17

the villefort vault formed square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance	898.47
know not whom look and judge for	340.73
artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her	91.67
the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said artagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his	123.99
and artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his	530.44
artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos nudge of the knee by nudge	191.93
at first athos supported the association for time with his own	285.72
dantès saw that he must attack the	403.73
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient	253.15

most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same	67.60
he entered the apartment followed by man in	180.73
this philosophic reflection thought he will make great sensation	618.50
villefort impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was	335.29
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and	170.47

fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest	233.18
don maintain the contrary said	96.36

on the landing artagnan blushed in the antechamber he	159.34
at that moment the countenance of	56.51
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by different	581.69
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do and that was what was observing to this gentleman just	334.24
and do you propose to make this journey very shortly do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain	274.32
but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen	295.74
the count was it may be remembered most temperate	580.37
gladly said albert let us call love	88.20
of three guardsmen of the company	94.07
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his	169.15
what in the first place monsieur athos is	96.21
have not explained your wishes grandpapa said valentine addressing	580.84
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his	273.21
patience madame am coming to	207.76
from habit that is	213.47
you were with her then	225.66
you approve of him he is one of the most well bred young men	138.98
gentleman and	1759.76
from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of	357.01
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said word about the duke of	96.51
let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole	46.36
from whom from certain abbé	1612.10
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your master blood look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali blood still lingering	283.94
raoul was about to reply when artagnan bent down to his	69.33
danglars riveted attention eugénie composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important	777.74
well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you your excellency regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers neglected to bring	106.04
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her	136.61
at length the hour drew	148.73
porthos sucked his mustache muttering good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an	2027.60
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face	105.33
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in significant	204.31
to me to you and which discovered in the pocket book of the	134.86
this spaniard had in his service lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to	166.57
at the same moment violent crash was heard and cries of	138.97
he entertains very high opinion	718.27
when he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive	210.75
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in	278.73
franz may all die before that time thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is	398.58
with your permission said danglars bowing will precede you to show you the	127.98
olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of	273.92
halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with	322.12
he hoped then in conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his	160.62
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the	258.76
and what am to pay with brute said danglars	284.10
cannot endure the modern school of	973.46
presently by change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering cave going on for few seconds more he heard crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and	318.96
and where will you promise me not to repeat single word of what am about to tell you	81.18
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves	245.14
what that it is that as was cruelly bored as you say and as had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself invited gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed cast of	203.62
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is blemish on our	442.10
do you say as monk it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of	192.74
finally ten months and half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector visit but dream an illusion of the	305.99
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had	103.79
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of queen owe to you the life of my son and for this bless	93.36
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving predominant expression to the child face belonged rather to boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so	429.83
to command inferior beings was rather humiliation than pleasure for	984.01
my god have mercy upon me and uttering fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by	206.30
and now monsieur artagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take letter from me to the	97.24
what are you going to do at portsmouth asked	62.62
athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his	318.74
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for	95.78
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such step it would be much better to take as now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we	220.19
as for	62.55
and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis	373.83
is then all that have heard really true she	228.16
ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by	122.70
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of bow window and an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father	230.80
comminges then led the count to room on the ground floor of pavilion at the end of the	72.84
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the united	206.50

your treasure stammered	4643.96
no said villefort only return again at eleven clock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming man lifted up his eyes and	295.62
precisely was sure of it said	45.00
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maid	243.09
alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was	212.06
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athos apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it	138.91
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and	316.34
will try to accompany you said aramis though scarcely feel in condition to mount on	243.51
they then perceived two men conversing in the	188.74
franz épinay delightful travelling companion with whom made the tour of	877.57

for have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor	359.52
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it	306.65
you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against	485.44
in word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of	260.66
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis	226.54
that is all want interrupted	266.98
besides which the musketeer having exchanged hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter	490.95
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to	477.53
villefort suffocating pressed the doctor	1000.94
no by your	136.99
at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears	86.80
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her	91.22
oh thank you thousand times but how unless miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage smile lit up the old man face strange smile of the eyes in paralyzed	539.59
it is done monsieur she said with rattling noise which seemed to tear her	159.00
look there said maximilian laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for	435.55
who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed second	263.43

quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saint	223.99
that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves	99.25
know what am saying continued the marchioness must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have grandmother to bless her	194.03
épinay said he allow me to remind you at this moment which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint méran on her death bed that valentine wedding might not be	142.84
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past	621.45
the prince was said to be in person at	184.25
franz albert and the count continued to descend the	171.95
were you there then monsieur followed them from curiosity so that saw the combat without the combatants seeing	358.08
well said he will ask you the same question which charles	141.42
sire said blacas who had for moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that great peril threatens the king and so hastened to you	245.60
come said andrea you are man void of compassion ll have you turned	268.73
raoul had offered some opposition at first but artagnan made use of the comte de la fere name and paying visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the	107.86
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision	325.12
where the devil did you find out that at their ball it was apparent	130.63
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant bed of asparagus for his especial	110.18
no not that way beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the	249.36
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged few words together in low	305.72
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom artagnan had given to comminges	125.30
his name tell it me then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistance for began to comprehend that there was question of something worse than death the executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me uttered all at once frightful cry of pain and	198.52
you must require such user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg	157.32
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them	144.98
never mind renée replied the marquise with look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in woman nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal	268.41
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefort room who had said she would receive them	90.61
what the use of mentioning that what is done is	144.73
request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly sir if you please and my master lord	143.63
oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of god at least in your own name if not as priest then as	102.75
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like	75.81
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did	112.74
his breast was covered with coat of mail the knife was bent against	230.34
dantès pressed the gendarme hand as though he would crush	176.60
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be	321.03
see answered	468.26
feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful	164.30
eugénie danglars cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of man who will one day say to me vicomte you know give my daughter two	308.13
oh that no matter replied caderousse will go back with you to fetch the other	68.68

artagnan was the first to recover from his	79.13
he wore his elegant uniform artagnan was wrapped in sort of gray cloak the swiss was six feet high artagnan was hardly more than five the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded artagnan as an	295.07

cried albert you are not preacher to remain standing the host sat down having made each of them respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi	203.62
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for moment in order to strike some other old	258.40
go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting	86.59
good caderousse he said how happy you will	92.59
it seemed as if flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the	120.06
and too he exclaimed in low voice unite	268.93
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and	460.52
it was	61.44
yes sir was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained	141.86
without reckoning the wholly unexpected one am preparing to surprise them	548.86
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded the arms of germain pillon graces but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the	358.61
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that artagnan had not come to	101.22
how old are you your voice is that of young	159.53
will leave him at the place quit and he will conduct you to	102.88
woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much have my own opinion as to that	147.77

you are very	50.41
well don you intend to bring me another plate said	203.58
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what artagnan was aiming at we ask only for	181.89
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this	63.59
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and	212.54
but indeed am not prejudiced beyond the power of	369.21
haydée said morrel what has become of her she departed last	189.47
good bye	4288.88
debray stretched himself upon large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle	417.80

ah recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant yes excellency hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the	139.07
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon	212.23
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse	99.05
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman ever saw dear child said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain tear which glistened in the corner of her	246.64
nevertheless replied mordaunt could compel you command	826.02
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes ah how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since shall be obliged to kill	150.62
you see monsieur that you say it	98.13
at least hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to	85.72
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent	231.63
the first day he broke all the doors in with single push of his shoulder and expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left	204.19
during the days of his prosperity not festivity took place without himself and wife being among the	379.16
who married the marquis of saint méran daughter	185.35
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw	127.54
it was the governor who hearing of faria illness from the jailer had come in person to see	130.13
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high	304.94
it is indeed the same said he and now am to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror however in an hour shall know	238.11
the performance of the civil	492.72
two or three masks strove to knock his out of his hand but albert first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one the other and continued his course towards the church of san	428.27
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young	110.37
then he added with smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved	118.88
and what is the news you should not ask stranger foreigner for	291.15
that continued the cardinal arose not only from feeling of natural equity but likewise from plan have marked out with respect to	219.26
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the	146.88

tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his	1085.54
oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document certainly have	157.71
cover mine said	77.45
this new attack made no impression on	971.67
no no will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and have right to dictate the preliminaries as it is who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be	92.51
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed	169.59
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the	101.72
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and	625.97
astonishment was at its	245.88
think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the	214.97
you said let us die here recall to you that	120.26
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding	427.62
thank you she	19.17
as to artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with vigorous side thrust sent his sword	492.83
penelon penelon an old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his	355.82
yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and	488.51
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	1027.85
strange for had forgotten him said the	163.66
aramis was	200.12
bazin my friend said aramis you don seem to be aware that can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all have forbidden all signs of approbation or	144.64
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find	156.18

to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph oh would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis	498.20
the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on	314.61
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself	354.82
by his manner sir and his age he the second to	259.82
lord de winter went out making sign to felton who followed him shutting the door	82.65

in the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future	105.07
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very	486.42
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to artagnan will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your	259.35
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an	90.04
you may perhaps have hidden thought but not step not an action not fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived	364.81
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage	221.63
that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an	335.75
that paper must be torn to pieces said artagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of	180.64

besides shall be	71.53
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis	243.91
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of	394.96
de villefort who lives in the faubourg saint	102.14
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand number of papers and in the other packet of letters which he gave to	177.13
two months said	60.00
milady recoiled uttering	7261.50
and pray asked the baroness am responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost francs certainly it is not	155.62
what can it mean said debray to	114.16
neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or	1464.96
yes yes said de guiche strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have	556.26

the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house	86.78
no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such	208.65

who sent away madame de chevreuse she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised	230.40

this menace smothered the young man	684.70
avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the	133.94

the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button	277.72
oh more than can say kitty am mad for her kitty breathed second	531.34
president but in its	163.02

this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than	479.77
the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and avrigny prepared to	194.45
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid	136.83
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these	430.93
it was necessary my man was going to fire pistol at me but you how did you get rid of yours oh mine replied artagnan was not	161.70
martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with me guess what strasbourg pie asked	714.21
artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his	285.18
oh no never said planchet will never leave monsieur	133.30
it was alas the ghost of former	578.25
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is	108.08
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told	118.86
and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice what would you do should give up broussel said	105.15
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such way that you are always in the	105.56
the three lieutenants of the	300.75
for thousand pistoles said the	114.89
pardieu certainly all four we couldn leave our prisoners could we ah ah said	681.05
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what have to	92.84

so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new	370.57
the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on signal from their master followed him with every mark of	145.31
make no doubt glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot	666.48
artagnan examined her with rapid	462.59
the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and	520.83
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining	268.20
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal	303.77
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father	460.16
help help cried artagnan stop my horse has the	375.99
during this conversation dantès having exchanged cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that all depend upon it and very likely may not have to go so far as the prison to effect	286.94
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador he wished to enter it as	297.57
but all these arrangements he does not come himself said château	122.41
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to	114.95
the devil take the madman	465.52
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them	264.01
well said he they likewise have refused	113.58
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the	193.08

the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the	186.97
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like	95.00
how long have you been here since the th of	141.61
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus	239.22
but this did not arise from want of affection on the contrary from firm	241.43
mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in corner of the	261.61
barrois will open the door for you said valentine addressing	117.65

take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty	193.21
mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her	102.21
my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause suffer give me then strength to	310.60
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was	309.03
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse	162.87
burst of laughter was the answer but finished with	420.01
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to	127.72
peppino had little spare time so he had game of with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank bottle of	568.35

the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and	127.76
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the	475.98
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of	179.79

desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find	102.79
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the	351.93
then he added some words in low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife	146.97
what do think captain why think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn mean	201.19

there was great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her	276.75
if he proves himself worthy of it will do what can to advance his	278.41
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it true but at bottom have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and	488.17

the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous	124.61

by heaven cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousse great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count breast flew back	507.54
however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair	157.52
what is it	269.56
everything said the	14.35
maximilian morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless	273.65
and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho think said the beggar can undertake things more difficult and more important than	669.86
franz introduced me to her at rome replied	100.75
when they reached the steps raoul saw three	204.50
ah tréville enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will	479.75
such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret	353.83

sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult casuist with whom he had an	134.04
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand small	71.58
at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was serious	168.91
then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him part in front of the	115.02
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the	154.47
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the	122.70
de tréville courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he	180.85
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last month payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them	291.82
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to	68.70

monte cristo pointed to chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling	98.88

there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that agreed that shall find you to morrow at charenton oh don be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the	167.99

the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to	154.63

the crisis was terrible and rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested	681.93
thousand fiery darts are piercing my	2076.55
bazin uttered profound sigh and went out to look for the	112.65

what is this	52.32
since lord de winter left him am distracted	351.97
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his	430.48

the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his	201.82
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or	212.72
indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening	136.67

danglars had however protested against showing himself in ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the	482.20
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and rap was heard at the	99.24
which is evidently not his real name but fictitious	446.53
think madame danglars again requires your bottle he	276.37
then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow he knows everything know said	420.73
it is thus that wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villefort was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than	281.01
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that may execute edmond last	200.23
excuse me gentlemen said morrel but do not	34.20
and pray how do you know that it ought to do so at	44.10
not whisper not breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited	1456.96
the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband	103.22
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at	177.86
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the	103.86

ah monsieur returned albert would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside	264.03

if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of	810.53
these two men were the executioner	152.10
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for month inhabited small two storied house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only	338.92
bah you are	41.57
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously	249.94
is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of	152.40
let him	63.58
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as would have	240.39
from valentine the young man looked towards	79.82
do you talk of sacrifice	152.89
will not	156.79
if am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand must provide myself with diversion for my old age must turn	477.96
everything with him was multiplication or	1242.28
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him why you see he has good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the	211.89
what are you going to do cried	44.43
then he	594.45
the division being made by the light of bazin taper the two friends continued their road and quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint	166.19
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should	205.90
how very astonishing cried he at	308.76
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously	817.73
artagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of la conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to	179.72
at the same time he was man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled bassompierre bellegarde and the duke angouleme were called the petits	216.60
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was	45.87
artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of	782.40
he had therefore set off at furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint	168.59
what hate to day adore to morrow and vice	1501.29
well said the count what are you doing you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to	67.79
it was not difficult for him to overtake woman embarrassed with her	118.91
on approaching the house he	106.17
promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can	75.99
not at all my good	66.68
if durst say what believe on that head what you believe ought rather to say what	235.78
be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as veracious	473.12
let us choose place of rendezvous continued athos and in last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each	332.78
no no it is as have said maximilian there is no one in the world of whom can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me	178.45
it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected number of the malcontents at the same spot but concerted organized	173.46
and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he	120.97
is it not so certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied artagnan do you not entertain little fear on my account what have to fear why that may be dangerously wounded killed	103.21
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other	303.97
now lift me on my bed for can no longer support	180.43
the day tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day tomorrow he exiles me among the	256.48
they were	1762.96
you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country	66.31
an hour afterwards physician declared they were both poisoned through eating	1727.81
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid	289.40
do you regret them asked morrel with his open	180.91
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical	792.88
yes ruined now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet	639.65
how so you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de	61.88
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have better conscience than the	158.80
they arrived at ablain without	654.60
no mysteries no cloak to hide one self in no cunning policy here people laugh outright they weep for joy	1749.08
cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned	484.08
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow	129.50
that long job	4621.88
this time it was not wandering troop of partisans it was an entire	221.54
in the long run man knows more about politics than woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the	400.96
but monsieur de tréville is skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the	109.98
ah monsieur de rochefort have not told you already that had nothing to do with that the queen cannot you make allowances for the pettishness of queen and princess but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is	117.36
compared with such things what is the letter you have just read lover deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married	153.84
know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while am only moderately so know too that you are good marksman there we are about	209.89
when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be	203.40
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to	87.65
how much did it cost you eight hundred	265.35
pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their	1842.94

at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy	133.62
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of	108.89
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty	252.76
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked	173.32
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or	258.11
it would be pleasure worthy of prince to travel upon such	283.30
how do you mean the receipt	54.47
artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was light but could not find planchet in any of	156.42
it bears his signature as you see which is all	290.76
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full	282.20
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in	399.34
she opened and found the word	279.38
what do you say asked his wife pale as	79.79
but who are those others warn you that will never again work in the dark and that will know not only to what expose myself but for whom expose	209.31
twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his	230.88
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through throng of curious glances and whispering	177.76
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by	228.96
but pardon me are you free mean to ask if you are married ah as to that no replied athos	159.89
from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading commentaries_ and by danglars studying the of	290.95
lord winter is killed then inquired artagnan fixing his eyes on the	135.29
what impossible and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather am one of	75.04
moment caderousse face appeared at the grating in the	122.32
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be	61.19
where if may ask without	974.39
ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampa	261.15
we are reluctant to leave for single moment men whom our lackeys know to be	254.38
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus if you die will die with you that is all can say to	100.85
this was matter of dispute between the holy father and his	178.01
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through	183.21
it was as prey to this hallucination that artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the	232.17

you suppose that would ever accept the price of your life oh you cannot believe what you say let me act as please felton let me act as please said milady	157.73
oh find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but find him though dig forever monte cristo drew back in	293.69

how can that be yes forgery it is snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch	240.99
accordingly artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for	312.17

what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me always the same always the child corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and	270.21

they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the	526.41
monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely	198.51
athos cast cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near	173.49
pretended that disliked the idea that house belonging to my wife father and mother should pass into the hands of	234.05
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the	127.75

as for me replied athos to this recital am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my	141.41
he had but one thought to go forward and he	99.15
come come dearest valentine confess that what say is true lest be tempted to call you	657.52
artagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and	146.49
yes the queen and as proof of what say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you	88.51
you believed me to be dead did you not as believed you to be and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de	178.57

as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the	202.93
the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own	273.88
yes madame replied the	49.65
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished	497.93
bernouin conducted artagnan to the oratory where he sat down	329.12
just god he muttered whence comes this thought is it from thee since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the	287.95
that is not prudent said	67.70
mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such conversation he opened cromwell	146.96

de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining	208.91
wished to make an effort attempted to cry	156.07
in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful	394.46
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of	219.68
that my room replied	399.33
yes she said at your advice have made the	128.04
la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing	176.56
this last apartment was sort of dark room littered with	582.32
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and only discovered them by chance that is why have been so reserved with you dear	192.37
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did not guess truly is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied artagnan and as proof there is crown to drink my	334.69
no no my dear fellow do not confound our	166.40
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the	116.10
de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his	212.02
the bishop affected to speak in loud voice before every one of their previous	374.41
and who is the cause of all this annoyance my father as told	66.86
so near as that said the count but that is not in the	47.80
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her	164.79
that is to say two hundred more hundred pistoles for you and hundred pistoles for	62.25
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte	96.31
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the	163.43
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied	396.55
one word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the	83.21
morrel whispered what have you done to him nothing at least personally said monte	82.97
to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help see sections and and the foundation information page at	207.18
nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three	116.10
and tell you sir that you are	35.17
how do you feel barrois asked	79.73
all right said	193.35
well said the doctor moment silence will	179.79
ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all	130.52
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the	291.17
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you	121.50
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with violent effort the dinner	337.17
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same	116.91
remaining for short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the	160.57
not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his	200.11
in short if go will you go too will	372.35
take post chaise or	4274.58
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and will venture to tell her am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally	64.85
well you know he reigned over rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque	670.85
be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which artagnan took and shook in	108.05
when no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the	323.29
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear	205.42
you shall pass it by twenty	433.34
and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms	550.83
and who told you to defend the king the comte de la fere	38.87
emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to	82.93
yes gentlemen said artagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect fancy he is anxious still to	265.72
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of	228.17
albert is ten minutes	101.00
nor said madame danglars but you began sentence sir and did not	184.70
quarter of an hour later he was with the	81.07
woman with athos all continued artagnan there was certainly one with	196.30
ah that is where the art comes	190.92
oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this	151.66
there my hand	1061.81
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what	415.37
we must inform the	105.80
and that is situated at quarter of league from the	119.31
and before you went to the bastile will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my	60.15
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamond supposing that artagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his	141.66
the marines were	1469.43
believe with your majesty that monsieur de tréville guarantee is more than	109.26
ah my dear sir you will see whether cavalcanti is to be treated like common person and andrea gliding through the court like black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in	268.46
three months since it	86.28
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the	107.93
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the	137.78
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been	407.92
come my friend said he	51.63
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and	287.32
and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf	357.26
well said porthos in the first place make bargain with the mercer and good	169.86
louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably	792.18
how so it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to	130.55
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is	233.12
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the	558.17
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and woman was seen waving her hand to passenger on board the vessel about to	298.53
we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is strange question said	58.74
we have promised and we will keep our	105.78
ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the	178.36
monsieur artagnan repeated louis very well	401.53
during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone	222.98
from whom from	1483.16
de morcerf whose portrait by gros will also show	775.42
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become	196.13
where the devil shall say that he is so that he cannot try to rejoin him thought	58.74
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also	261.63
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english	290.27
and with us no other escort but you two is it not enough one of us would	295.82
well sir said madame de saint méran few minutes reflection must hasten the marriage for have but short time to	105.49
artagnan and which she had given her son	164.47
well how has all gone off zounds you know there only one way of saying things so went in and said my lord we were not the strongest	308.56
his first remark on entering was you know sir do not speak french know you do not like to converse in our language replied the	271.77
valentine poured the orangeade into glass and gave it to her grandmother with certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the	119.55
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is	97.83
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute passion so strange and as it were	320.06
if obtain the situation desire shall owe it	635.70
very sorry monsieur but was here first and will not sail	419.89
and if you wished to die you would choose this death count	132.93
it seems his former master accustomed him to	332.43
you are good fellow and kind hearted messmate replied edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but do not wish anyone to stay with	238.72
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers would make your	212.14
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos	292.05
oh whatever may	173.42
it is the son of milady said athos to	30.18
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his	114.97
and any additional terms imposed by the copyright	991.82
you may madame said he with	209.68
were our object money only he said we should be rich	312.62
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter	96.59
danglars leaped into the carriage like young man of	105.69
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by profound	151.26
here are thirty francs will sleep at the rouge_ and will secure place in the first	206.88
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all	215.90
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be	128.10
ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are come now what are your conditions rest yourself first my lord and we we will	198.56
all is ready for to morrow	279.54
well then your eminence said the queen must inform you that	66.30
the queen will never banish me and even were obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or	210.01
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself besides what would the sailors say what would the patron think he must	225.32
in strafford company said mordaunt	3427.59
as franz was about to take leave	57.39
then thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose was your accomplice so took what little money had and the best of my things and got	245.38
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on	141.30
but how is it that you know so much of these matters know them because the men of whom speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because did them all the harm could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom had most to do gave me pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that received from the same hand it closed an old	240.63
have brought him	137.82
well amiable corsican let us suppose it is	539.29
it struck me as very odd that princess should live in the rue aux	426.24
the other is on the contrary to all appearance true nobleman but do you not fear to find him bully only fear one thing namely to find man who will not	188.38
and have none either said the	114.30
to the visitors room said the same	106.88
all at once he uttered terrible	190.04
at least keep him there till my daughter be	351.27
explain yourself	2310.20
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt paper in the pocket and drew it out it was letter addressed to you	434.08
no he wished to speak to your excellency told him you were gone out and some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already	96.65
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which have in my own	254.82
on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then artagnan opened the closet	150.86
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution	112.25
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like clever architect the plan andrea had left	323.29
all paris were in the	107.00
hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in	224.57
yesterday affair must have shaken him little his voyage would upset him	975.63
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my	205.14
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to	162.16
but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon artagnan with sticks shovels and	203.48
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted	80.33
without doubt he recognized artagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his	168.83
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said	211.04
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me	352.40
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie cheeks had lord wilmore seen what now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the	281.50
yes chef oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied	3373.25
danglars looked at the two men one the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with	236.29
you have charming young person with you tonight count said	269.27
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and	264.89
ah to be	36.63
hold on wait said aramis that is an idea of which invite you to take advantage my	75.75
as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support	59.62
no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its	473.52
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal	276.64
that will do said he leave the rest to	72.22
yes replied porthos	416.69
has this woman been relating her crimes to you in that case can comprehend the length of the	137.80
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the	87.34
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château if and the tower of	315.05
ah said	52.61

once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition	566.53
very well and you what will you do return to	80.73
the queen ran to little table on which were ink paper and	401.63
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove source of wealth and	197.71
indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit	142.44
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept	163.64
oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket pair of small pistols loaded to the	234.17
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on	309.64
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of artagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady said	66.84
madame said villefort believe me fortune of francs is not so easily	275.41
faster faster he cried in tone which electrified the	462.28
where at your	361.42
but what are we to do make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your	207.05

and do you really flatter yourself that shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been	229.57
that woman was once young girl as beautiful as she is	168.86
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her	176.82
do not think wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at	115.38
ay and observe it just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the	425.19
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build	312.51
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar podium to escape jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of column and immediately opposite large aperture which permitted him to enjoy full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic	610.88
in one case or the other the trial was soon	171.15
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the	147.71
and bernouin do not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your	87.24
declare said porthos shall eat nothing if they do not take it	85.91
he was man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military	208.71
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made good	392.77
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply have suffered deeply madame answered monte	225.02
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the	166.68
how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me credit opened by thomson french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which paid him with checks on the	250.26
grimaud replied	71.03
they set	91.89
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with	78.61
artagnan who was accustomed to his friend manner of acting and who perceived immediately by word gesture or sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos arm and went out without saying	233.92
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning	246.93
de la trémouille protestant and seeing the king seldom was of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social	319.34
you see said	26.39
but will tell	26.84
it is well in the meantime we will have merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your	141.59

in fact her position was	192.18
was thinking my dear old friend that when you were musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more	184.40
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with convulsive	635.93
was he placed here when he first arrived no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to	136.58
ah count said he his father loves him so much do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed will make him	73.20
de la trémouille people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with	166.34
he left there three	403.01
at midnight they arrived at the gate of beautiful	134.55
without her captain cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my	225.42
sinbad the sailor	132.82
who told you there was woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as	107.33
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony	337.23
you can understand dear friend with what hope was inspired by that last	222.41
will even venture to say that am	120.32
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached	146.03
that was superb throw so left off	865.10
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real	264.55
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning bargain by which he gained round profit of at least eighty per	850.80
ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur	46.87
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that	179.45
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired	608.98
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked	178.93
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it pastille about the size of pea which he placed in her	175.80
and who thus advised you no other than your friend monte	113.69
loose half drunk imposing the king musketeers or	603.55
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less	1093.27
if there are two let parry kill one and you the	315.65
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and	272.21
villefort only answer was stifled	2025.63
porthos plan appears to me to be impracticable said artagnan inasmuch as am myself ignorant of what instructions can give	184.56
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly	184.77
three times presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me	208.25
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than artagnan he had fancied he saw second head man head inside the	241.45
the major eyes dilated with pleasing	1282.94
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other	121.24
count said albert in low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her	74.46
why the good god sends him back	342.13
come gentlemen said he they are beating the	155.04
oh god prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead oh god murmured the girl leave me my mother your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning	259.07
it was	93.07
he had passed the night standing and without	124.92
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had right to superiority of position superiority which edmond had concealed from all	379.08
the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the	345.38
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with double	225.87
what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of	203.76
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about	339.72
did you pass through the corso	161.30
on arriving in paris artagnan found letter	261.63
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army	276.03
get on it that it	203.80
as was saying last night they intend me to be	383.55

very good very good but the wound remains and will reopen at the first	271.16
and can you find him hope	111.45
suddenly terrible cry cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery	342.80
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked	91.85
but this is infamous cried	124.59
de morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and	268.74
because you remain eternally encircled in round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional	980.33
where does your highness wish to go to some elevated spot whence can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case your	290.24
spur your horses whip get on the coachman bestowed heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over round and flexible	453.96
villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his	50.11
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said artagnan if you persist in offering him	148.57

it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes certain artagnan béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to	191.22
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question	311.29

when first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first	175.84
at his door he perceived figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for	87.98

then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with	170.43
at the same time continued artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs year it seems to me that little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said	145.14

albert hesitated	2110.11

if am killed well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our	122.91
the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the	49.21
but others wish that you should go	186.41
it is war said the	52.00
the reader hushed herself	8205.59
determined to put the advice	42.87

as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the	140.37
yet he did not return	67.11
not even to athos or porthos have not breathed syllable to	312.86
everything that savors of mystery charms	1936.77
madame danglars blushed in spite of all her	143.03
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of little army	502.90
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the	216.45

he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of	127.45
contact the foundation as set forth in section	591.10

this voice was heard by the two friends who set off full	83.21
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the	164.00
artagnan he called out in coaxing voice will you answer for everything will answer for	177.56
his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with false	245.86

can you tell us where we can obtain sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he	203.30
at five clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by	130.92
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly	989.26
monsieur mordaunt he said since running one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have little conversation if you	190.96
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to	109.90
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with	247.75

and then continued	162.57
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of	267.56

and here madame must add another word of	569.31

the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their	433.43
ah so you are not mazarinist delightful indeed you could not belong to	152.63
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take boat and in that strange manner they approached the	123.63
well am	314.34
good said aramis taking purse which bazin presented to	256.59
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most	198.47
artagnan came forward and stammered out few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the	207.77

from whom his eminence sent	131.22
who goes there cried hoarse	978.19
as artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice	103.18
learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of	403.00

but you have then valet de chambre who knows paris said	131.50

resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman have said what have	135.07

am happy to	80.68
yes yes but let us	37.67
and you know added artagnan that whenever catch him will kill him this	266.28
that reply led to several questions about the king capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished	924.20
and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur artagnan who is concerned in this matter do not perceive how can take his	101.57

it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parry	817.29
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where artagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near	277.85
the valet instantly brought to his master regimental hat with wide	972.71
and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing word or movement to escape	293.37
the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the	107.57
in fact moment	689.45
