sir said she perfectly understand my grandfather meaning at all	43.27
the count was silent but continued to gaze around	16.16
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and	78.92
if your friend remains another week in my cellar shall be ruined	124.71
save me oh no said he but help me to die if you	33.37
bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing	199.53
candle of coarse tallow on black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less	243.31

cannot believe continued felton in voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this	167.82
then he said to himself must put this to the test but without compromising	110.27
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study	109.62
dead dead groaned forth villefort in paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that	100.90

gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there the enemy	387.73
well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search	99.93
ah you philosophize replied villefort moment silence during which like wrestler who encounters powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you had nothing else to do should seek more amusing	654.82
the mother and daughter passed the night	80.93
he started on seeing the cavalier with the	18.95
with word artagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais	128.57
you asked for candor and you have	151.09
but artagnan was not of character to allow man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule	64.04
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the	18.91

days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in	119.45

bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not	268.33
well on the faith of	143.49

grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la	120.03
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of	161.92
he spoke italian like tuscan and spanish like castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villefort	296.55
yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am to act how can it be effected someone must be sent to the	76.91
lucien said the baroness assure you have no desire to sleep and that have thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing	70.54

had valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young	89.07
said my good fellow that would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses	391.32
he pushed the door open and	11.21
as to aramis he dwelt in little lodging composed of boudoir an eating room and bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his	476.36
rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saint méran insist	133.37
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the	55.02

the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his	92.33
this room was occupied by dantès	27.06
and the next day	284.96
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey	93.70
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and	270.66
gentlemen will see the king this evening but as to you do not advise you to risk doing	41.86
ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make visit oh yes of course mouston nothing	145.55
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed	113.93

one alone is left to me but he is one of those known believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to	44.23
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing	36.62
the priest gazed on the person addressing him with long and searching gaze there even seemed disposition on his part to court similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with strong italian accent you are	613.37
what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yes	248.99
with the enmity of the	66.09
if it were not ridiculous to make display of our triumph said morrel would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to	182.77
so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting great millionaire or capricious	195.90
well what has this bandit to do with the order have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but very much doubt your returning by the	122.66
then taking paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	76.14
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is	121.41
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another	234.55
jean had struck three quarters past	34.76
it was in fact small craft from dunkirk bound for	174.73
yes and	346.33
so much the worse had much rather you were french and myself also they would hate us both	89.92
you know bragelonne said athos never speak without	40.15
have with you for one throw said	14.83
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his	91.33
he must be	1556.92
danglars nodded to signify that he was	78.17
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample	480.04
why didn they search more vigilantly they would have found they have not found but they are on the	95.79
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue	137.09
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats observed cannon on the road saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon	114.98

well la ramee who is gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that shall try	355.79
ah if were in your place said	41.15
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room	85.06
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted	286.20
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking word without making	97.24
monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured	143.78
two royal pages were playing with	185.90
that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes	43.85
inflexible man she	175.77
planchet turned and returned the	45.58
my mother replied the young princess cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont	114.12
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness but we must say farewell edmond and let us	122.63
haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me said	91.33
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite	61.49
but at the very moment when artagnan stretched out his hand to receive	29.40
how did you fare for my part ate but	67.15
really count you do nothing and have nothing like other	225.28
matters are going all	23.71
an opportunity will come replied	143.17
with the eagle glance of sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only gull hovering over the waves the sail of sloop which was directed toward the coast of	155.74
in the first place said milady it is possible may be deceived and that artagnan and his friends may really come to your	54.73
anne blushed and buried her face in her	33.63
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the	83.08
but that does not affect the	46.56
the vessel was very old to risk that said the	28.82
in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the	44.56
de saint méran death which took place on the first stage he left	66.50
mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed	267.39
he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of	169.45
from that moment the old man eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit	23.74
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at	261.83
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying	340.64
speak out my	15.36
this was the more so because bonacieux reflections were all rose	73.16
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in week and in three days there is to be grand feast betrothal	104.25
saw the executioner return into the king room change his clothes put on black hat and large cloak and	74.80
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty	80.89
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis	466.75
it is upon one higher placed than am that god has laid this	197.06
make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and will always consult upon our	191.19
lutheran say believe such is the case do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in	65.82
bravo said athos that does honor to your	63.16

the popular banker found that it answered better than	119.67
my lord answered the gascon differ from monsieur herblay entirely as to the last point though agree with him on the	100.75
letters had been despatched	30.13
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with	78.68
well said franz this	22.93
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way	52.35
do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account beseech	72.86
the streets are full of armed men continued	16.81
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de	75.97
hope shall gain renée favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on	276.18
artagnan looked with stupefaction at man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of king in the prosecution of his	159.46
on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the	202.47
what are you going to do asked	19.51
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this	69.07
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle	189.46
it must have been for his hide for the carcass is not worth eighteen	133.82
de monte	2.13
danglars raving threw himself on the goat	861.87
oh my lord bishop he cried seizing juxon hands where is providence where is providence my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal	136.81

must have said the duke proof of his connection with	36.33
have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties retained the sense of my	131.70
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was	48.02
door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest	299.52
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just	44.07
the same expression	26.20
he is proud soul he is man by himself you are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you aramis said athos are you jesting no no dear friend state only what we all	151.81
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated have assassinated then and not executed am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with	170.25
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline one self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory	315.25
the rendezvous	106.53
the safety of cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his	86.49
and with my grandfather consent shall fulfil the promise which have made	45.96

it was worn by my father loyal	69.50
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our	106.02
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian	167.42
what hundred thousand francs for fowl ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves come come this is very droll very amusing allow but as am very hungry pray allow me to	2758.93
nothing is	7793.92
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other	427.05
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by artagnan inventive	205.55
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have claim being almost one of the family and will give as many rendezvous of that kind as can find persons willing to accept	101.25
ten minutes labor the wall gave way and hole large enough to insert the arm was	111.60
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he	159.86
saved my child said morrel what do you mean yes saved saved see see said the young	39.23

then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the	50.49
will write letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to	95.54
an instant porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon	16.91
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of rival	95.33
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged do indeed and this swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and	153.91
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and	121.59
now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall tell you the cause of all these stupidities it is because at your theatres by what at least could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of phial or suck the button of ring and fall dead	450.20
monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the	98.21
did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words did but they were uttered in the romaic	326.88
where is he there in the	93.92
don know what it	23.22
and yet notwithstanding these precautions remained for some time in terrible agitation of	112.76
grimaud meantime undid the means of	1306.96
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately	15.48
now mousqueton he said hope you don mean to desert your master ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea	429.15
he approached	86.87
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech	100.03
porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating shall follow up on my	169.70
finally milady stopped and bitter smile passed over her	47.62
what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my	140.71
cries of despair resounded on all	50.81
if took them and were detected should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs year so that should be great fool to run such risk for three	280.27
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence artagnan went straight to the residence of	79.60
it was at this moment artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor carriage and few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut	45.64
and if ever am reconciled with the court shall prove to you hope that remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names artagnan and porthos artagnan and	91.05
then you have nothing more to do here no everything is all right	36.74
milady breathed deep sigh and	46.17
exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake	106.08
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat	83.12
saw the soldier shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for was fearful he might also see	130.01
and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition did not think that was the way of your	128.93
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again	64.25
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell	76.77

eleven clock had	281.05
what were you doing on that armchair asked	29.67
ah there another brave and excellent young	27.97
artagnan then saw musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his	123.74
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost	267.39
oh never make matches my dear prince it is my settled	143.54
what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill	28.56
but have no permission to shoot over this	148.85

there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in great	241.18
artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du	110.00
oho cried artagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of ali	96.57
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow	90.40
he opened it and read as follows	29.59
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your	34.30

scott of course the son of an ill fated sire and the father of yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to violent and unhappy	294.76

this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him	267.47
it appeared light and well	109.93
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as am not gentleman may be allowed to	123.96

the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had	128.16
artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen	112.83
ought not to have driven bargain when it was to equip cavalier like	102.80

madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well	160.84
but the man who was under him was an accomplice of the duke and escaped along with	20.05
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham	156.72

the four old friends prepare to meet	20.13
in the chamber of artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and	29.33
valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her	313.61
fernand rose	432.94
every door was opened to	29.61
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me few other instructions relative to your future	394.02
when will your majesty deign to receive him tomorrow at midday	97.95
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least	314.26

the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what clock it was he was shown monsieur de chavigny watch it was then half past six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain	426.43
the next day the prisoner room was full of pictures and	89.09
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained	394.32
the duke walked so fast that artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	66.42
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his	43.17
the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of musketeer wore an enormous cloak said	65.05
oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her	57.54
the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the	332.97
he thought moment cut branch of resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this	169.84
the day passed away as rapidly as an	9.44
well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but refusal distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled	451.33

see that have made trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join	182.64
and now when are we to go asked	18.10
reflect how glorious day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what should	226.36
he cried out and staggered against the wall like drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé cell to his own and said must be alone to think over all	97.13
do we breakfast or dine must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle	75.67
will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command	72.28
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his	589.69
the young man then entered the apartment of	13.96
would it be better to remain here said athos and take turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort faith aramis believe me there is little left to	198.96
understand you or rather am	71.45
he sent immediately for cabriolet and hastened to the publisher	135.26

my friend said he here is proof of	20.12
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was	54.07
you have forgotten it porthos said	32.36
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped	93.80
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing room saw haydée who had fallen on chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown	117.44
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to	113.17
for what for the sake of fighting yes understand that but what is the quarrel people fight for all sorts of reasons you	83.88
the cortege proceeded to notre dame where te deum was	230.84

and he set off to follow the two	25.09
two hours he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges	288.39
it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home the pretty cast an anxious glance at artagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on	335.88
porthos you are as vain as narcissus plainly tell you so replied	77.93
caderousse stared at his wife with much	169.41
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial	231.49

you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre	140.35
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments quem	178.65
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your	97.01
shall be expecting you and if you fail to come shall think for how do know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with	296.31

this assurance determined the two friends to accept	18.82
well then it is settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen for what purpose wish to receive her majesty commands from her own	96.72

grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished	275.34
because happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest	45.92
do you see that ray of sunlight	27.06
you are afraid are you well if you do not go this very instant will have you arrested by the queen orders and will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so	57.20

ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its	303.06

you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted	93.31
then you do not know who it is that attempts your life no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo	119.44
which would not prevent me said artagnan if knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him sharp turn vow that would voluntarily risk my head in doing	162.01
don be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my	143.71
this evening the margin of possible delay	459.71
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest	122.04
and madness have been nearly mad and you know the axiom bis in	249.02
danglars felt the irony and compressed his	68.42
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga	277.13
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	60.28
both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe	455.72

the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe	83.87
am told it is delightful place it is	98.79
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed	67.55
now one evening when artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about quarter of league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching	378.72

yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little	60.98
de morcerf it is providence which punishes	120.76

the hostess as she entered saw artagnan and uttered little cry whereupon artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her	112.91
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and	48.80

the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon	192.28

but to die for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die danglars resembled timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its	771.87

make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son	95.93
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than	98.09
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of artagnan hand the musketeer felt	86.42
not at	18.59
at least wait until the story has	132.99
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green	50.14

was he young or old about six or seven and twenty years of age should	69.04
at the end of quarter of an hour faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where avrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in	105.88
alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my	13.52

on the summit of rising ground little in advance of the enemy appeared short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by	99.92
means for classical tragedy moment of silence employed by milady in observing the young man who listened to her milady continued her	162.46

you would be no longer lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like mushroom in the	178.81
you persist then swear it before the god who hears	82.58
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an	596.91
the soldiers seized dantès who followed	55.40
and your precautions were successful completely	100.57
thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced more appalling	200.58
and the consequence said artagnan in great	144.68
ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself should my dear artagnan have been so but nature said	96.09
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of	156.07
and as the man approached artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by	124.99

in word an almost poetical fervor	3281.89
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in bride of	238.12

here he said take this pocket	45.62
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port	213.45
you have told me yourself madame that have been drawn into snare perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange have for some time had presentiment that should shortly	176.62
must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be happy and suitable	176.88
ah here is my mother cried the	45.96
de boville manifested signs of extraordinary	104.72
was as told him resolved to die of	72.55

the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents	248.22
and cried artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which artagnan on arriving had observed saddled	309.28
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son now remember having had the honor of meeting	181.52
at ten clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little	82.55
contempt my friend how does this misfortune affect you no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father	230.23
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of	37.48
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and slight though meaning smile passed over his	73.86
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of	37.41
nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you	27.69
describe to me your abduction pray	95.77
valentine said morrel death is in itself	133.83
burning fire red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my	126.05
this measure somewhat reassured	214.51
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony	60.17
omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate morsel from their hands on the stones of the street they departed	209.82
so have little adventure to propose to you when the count is	44.38
before him rose grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent	266.65
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and to	192.39

athos porthos and aramis you are looking for them	28.88
artagnan shrugged his	4.71
who and where is he he is	17.27
and who had lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn have too much	270.20

yes yes	331.68
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in	91.50
whether he kept watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody	313.85
there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called	458.11
the pistol fell from his	25.13
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino yes was the laconic	326.63
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with knife	147.11
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their	77.06
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain	218.65
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and	23.42
where is he in my wife chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his	122.75

those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally strange influence on father mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his	1261.98

what is it said artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his	97.77
peppino turning around shouted fowl for his excellency his voice yet echoed in the archway when handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing fowl in silver dish on his head without the assistance of his	372.93
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressing room which he	51.11
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian	295.41
to be	100.19

this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger	189.01
but you are man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before	93.52
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its	56.43

the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another	58.58
and they both went into low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for fencing	518.52
and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action it is not for me to	83.18
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord	138.87

but lose no time we have lost too much	46.66
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar	41.52
but fernand was mistaken man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly	105.63
the little boat bounded over the waves like nut	201.38

then if should require more continued monte cristo in careless manner why of course should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than year and during that period scarcely think shall exceed the sum	219.67
de villefort spoke of it to me paralysis	111.19

the two friends were crouching down meantime behind tub in the side	182.35

and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to	70.71
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular	351.21
you were rich when married you but little	56.96
and then commenced roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his	193.41
morrel service and most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of	85.48
on entering the banker mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant	108.31

and you failed they positively	72.18
he calls that language but never mind that will do	75.79
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed	449.97
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos	189.10

the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always	120.92
the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and	91.41

how so asked	80.01
and as hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him wish to warn him that he may be on his	43.61
look and artagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal	244.07
you laugh	106.85
the sum was collected in	31.67
now planchet has an excellent memory and will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to	187.76
and the baron pointed with slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his	80.97
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her	41.16
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the	119.52

at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her	103.75
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but cannot they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their	631.91
no no to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the	122.13

whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and man with lantern in his hands and enveloped in cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly	202.72
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his	298.79

while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master	494.42
stay think told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps can render you this slight service	181.13

signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes he said the count awaits your	115.65
as the count title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with	309.84

nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great	242.94

and yet you said he had	75.30
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the	122.42
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly	341.72
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la	66.02

but remember it perfectly interposed the darling	224.11
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach	101.61

he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count box at the argentina and valle	89.91
that ring comes from milady cried athos with voice in which it was easy to detect strong	139.82
what might be the consequences however he had not ventured thus far to draw	41.93

aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost	24.40
breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time very strong light he perceived the fine writing of	349.78

besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties artagnan would become the preserver of his	183.55
what ails you my dearest father are you ill inquired the young man much	98.78
the queen had just regained her chamber and artagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	61.70
hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music	274.08
or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become	205.29
meantime artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the	69.97
you monseigneur yes or at least	88.02
then tell me all you know about the	59.65
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of	217.07
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the	408.35
madame said he bear to your majesty letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his	84.61
indeed am replied the young magistrate with smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more	137.68
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle	41.88
what does scandal signify to me what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your	6316.74
what is your errand then with me sir mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace mean to propose meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the	445.03
if on the contrary die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate	42.42
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges or	154.57
no matter said artagnan in his most wheedling	70.68
it is not only valuable diamond but it is an enchanted	99.72
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady	85.94
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	327.18
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	68.80
particularly when there is money in the house eh answered caderousse double locking the	69.16
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural	70.34
you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	91.35
it is nearly eight clock and at nine expect	67.72
this exclamation which corresponded to the count own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with	169.55
hunting for the equipments chapter	161.83
épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep promise and fulfil	255.13
by the way have received news of	23.70
listen he said today is the th of september is it not	14.66
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and artagnan more than	292.55
gracious heaven exclaimed	32.99
what would you have said monte cristo we are all	61.20
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the	324.56
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and	11.83
chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the	86.96
yes said	18.13
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of man who lifts weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon	194.86
so in twelve times you thrice missed the	177.83
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last	117.78
de bracieux de pierrefonds added	42.80
inter cœlorum	37929.47
ask him then for the written	36.05
and where are we going asked	13.61
épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary	230.87
franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his	72.86
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen will you permit grandson of henry	320.29
mean young man whom you patronize monsieur de	78.36
can trust you you are true frenchman am an old soldier of rocroy my	180.74
have induced you to take charming promenade here is delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each	741.99
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous	330.82
swallow every morning spoonful of the mixture prepared for my	134.86
well baron promise you some good exercise said the	396.00
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide	357.83
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man	100.67
give me anything you like it is of little	31.84
john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his	183.05
something better still	308.46
believe me dear albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling believe me feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way can serve you am	103.89
he must be mad said the	19.53
no one has letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of	84.71
extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped	121.03
yes said felton but silence silence must have time to file through these	109.15
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the	271.69
had it been possible to save you should have considered it another proof of god mercy and would again have endeavored to restore you swear by my father	126.63
do you wish for name should you like to be rich and your own master said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such question take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pont de	435.74
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon	104.88
jeune amélie_ was first at the	99.87
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his	60.02
oh do something for	21.14
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with	37.50
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in	60.50
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to	48.33
oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against minister of	366.91
somebody there received your packet and gave you letter in place of it think yes the grand marshal	50.97
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due	74.56
you do not reply to my question replied the inspector	66.84
they then dressed	162.86
major cavalcanti	78.32
and how shall be dressed demanded	81.38
anne de bueil murmured the wounded	44.33
for me said artagnan seizing the	17.22
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	74.34
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed set of pearly	121.73
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open door then went forward	80.27
burnt it for fear that even fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your	125.62
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following	50.37
he will inform against	13.15
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same	98.31
then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé	33.26
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful manner to be sure remember it all	124.94
it was however too late albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker	84.50
you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the	342.48
raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing	112.07
we will be with you at that time said the	35.07
indeed on my	63.35
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the	48.53
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive	29.12
de monte cristo	74.45
does he still live inquired the	62.11
some years	356.39
but there was more difficulty in arousing	150.71
no we heard think the sound of her but she remained perfectly	53.20
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you how could know what was the bearer of that true and you are going to portsmouth have no time to	107.41
that all you know of him asked	25.57
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have nice little fricassee	769.76
but repeat to you am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from	81.72
he will come in here	15.09
he would have spoken but his voice failed	24.59
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if fresh thought suggested itself to her	88.96
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch of	82.09
well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve	179.45
well said milady for you will	40.98
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy am to attribute the violence that is done me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in	246.33
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally	61.43
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	71.66
tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest	25.26
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in hollow of the	203.71
no one had more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like	118.48
what he continued can have been following false path can the end which proposed be mistaken end can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not sacrilegious undertaking cannot reconcile myself to this idea it would madden	373.28
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the count heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young man shoulder said was looking for you my	166.43
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried	23.20
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till	42.35
ah dear artagnan see how regularly live and how easy am	201.17
knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then	51.32
artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin ante	56.37
ah indeed said	76.72
gaspard caderousse he had married woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her	73.08
you have only to wait here till release	16.63
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went	82.85
then it seems am to eat alone remarked the	50.85
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres thought should find four axes for one as was to meet four	301.50
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and	167.52
look at my hat and	37.95
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen was afraid you were dangerously	132.64
then you abandon me doctor yes for can follow you no farther and only stop at the foot of the	140.05
it was large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of	193.49
whenever your majesty	38.26
was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have	190.47
athos then made him sign to take up his basket and to walk on	63.83
she learned drawing music	138.61
another method of assassination said the general shrugging his	62.78
but can continue to visit madame de chevreuse should say you could and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both	163.21
how was it that presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès	131.36
and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the	102.40
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the	32.24
aramis then joined athos and artagnan who were consulting	169.41
the brief space had however been sufficient for man followed by number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost	205.15
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm	36.60
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if do not make it although have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand maintain my original	245.43
artagnan pursued his	25.24
de château	2.05
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king	46.50
de tréville in feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and have hastened to receive your	173.69
alas madame exclaimed artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had just idea of	134.52
countenance nothing that is	185.40
and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the	204.78
good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly	249.58
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such	112.29
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the	419.17
besides in accepting it she added in voice full of emotion you render me much greater service than you	124.86
the misfortune is great but think you have still good number of falcons sparrow hawks and	308.04
you have my word monsieur and here is my	20.65
what must do to attain such sublimity you are today free as air come and dine with me we shall be small party only yourself my mother	173.77
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	81.39
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his	40.56
let us drink my dear artagnan let us drink while the wine is fresh let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me little of what is going on in the world	103.41
in the rue	12.75
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at	267.85
monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given	99.03
ah said andrea when may we hope for that pleasure on saturday if you will	44.22
everything was in	16052.94
and he heaved	7.74
well at the end of ten days you would have taken centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as	168.23
what are you doing said	27.33
he turned towards porthos and	63.73
the devil murmured he between his	28.86
droll way of showing your	66.70
what is that to find such wife as my father	41.18
and you artagnan twenty	20.31
morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder	22.66
do you know what has become of athos asked artagnan of planchet as they galloped	56.01
de villefort answered morrel but was of madame de saint	23.57
think should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his	66.51
the servant bowed and	31.72
at four clock artagnan recommenced his	479.13
yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and	161.87
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on journey which would detain him some	74.18
oh father father murmured she courage the has gone down then said morrel in hoarse	83.52
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of postilion whose only answer was	199.97
come said danglars you appear to me good sort of fellow and hang me should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely	123.07
undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me	53.25
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed	120.95
sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my	37.99
shall either return for them myself or shall send courier directing you to bring them to	141.32
then sleep here my dear	41.41
guessed all followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in parquet box have seen	77.40
will but go and return sire shall be back in ten	31.79
ah valentine assure you you are	25.40
you must set out for	60.35
and kitty who had not let go the hand of artagnan led him up little dark winding staircase and ascending about fifteen steps opened	167.23
danglars be there he has already been invited by my	26.69
have you something to tell me asked	16.19
not very said	86.03
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured	22.75
the young man uttered groan but appeared	35.85
in an hour it will be at the	30.12
you don imagine he would consider little thing like that at any rate said porthos am glad to hear artagnan admit that he is	122.62
you know have made the most of my arms though never forgot my	49.24
noirtier wants said the	96.46
will take him dead that	35.32
the place	64.24
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over	111.16
good god cried she two thousand livres why that is fortune porthos made most significant grimace	261.23
of what oh that is not my secret must not therefore tell	23.30
ask pardon of your eminence said artagnan but was so fatigued don ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my	84.29
tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making violent effort over himself he said have right to insist on your giving me an	162.16
olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the	54.54
de villefort are both coming to this	66.76
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time think all must be	51.77
morrel didn dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old man being so pleased to think that you who were perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but love him for showing so much interest in	310.53
if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the	62.51
will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an	74.95
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes	622.26
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the	195.16
you are too bad athos one can hide nothing from you answered	67.22
oh that very well young man	51.66
then sudden idea crossed the mind of	58.58
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep	33.62
and did you also discover bitter taste	50.54
ah miss three they were here last night sir am sure they were here counted	131.22
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings	218.64
that prohibition is not for me said	88.29
and of what did he die asked caderousse in choking	90.73
how said	81.69
am all attention said	9.99
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their	80.24
grimaud he cried remain wish	30.88
well decapitator guardian of the state royalist brutus what is the matter said	660.97
yes my lord at any rate think	28.85
felton in his turn suppliant clasped his	21.08
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly	81.55
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner	9.77
do not deceive	4956.38
will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their	84.69
come my brother go with me added artagnan and will see that you are made duke no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with	394.21
the marquis took his arm and they left the	15.64
the house may be suspected but deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur artagnan for can affirm sire if can believe what he says that there does not exist more devoted servant of your majesty or more profound admirer of monsieur the	201.15
yes he has wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of ruined man he has besides son lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his	633.50
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall single word indicating any previous acquaintance between	152.87
it is the first time then that you ever went to that house	38.08
say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his	116.81
when you return will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by	158.07
the idea of asking how hear the news he	13.24
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo eye was on	89.04
to the boat to the boat but porthos do not see	9.57
have an engagement with pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till	194.11
that someone has done society great	43.16
countersigned by you the best thing can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your	59.27
this is detail preserved to us by	202.66
come come that is not bad said	81.54
the island of tiboulen	2533.93
cause her to lose hundred thousand francs and that would teach her	101.31
was not your second cried	27.03
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy	321.21
his excellency is not perhaps aware	25.87
it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me	153.72
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his	36.86
villefort had never been so concise and	323.07
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos having assured ourselves they have nothing in their	106.60
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead man face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the	80.32
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other	35.21
it is my will	67.99
himself artagnan here himself but that impossible he is at the siege of la rochelle with the	44.36
my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall fire off ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle saddle	431.45
so they have picked up the word and the are called frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was la fronde bread la fronde hats la fronde to say nothing of gloves pocket handkerchiefs and fans but listen at that moment window opened and man began to sing tempest from the fronde did blow to day think twill blow sieur mazarin	1963.35
you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising	129.69
probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable	91.94
is the baroness at home inquired	10.80
grimaud turned round with jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the	66.15
you are right said monte cristo and have	32.47
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being	103.26
now you get angry and attack our poor	152.45
well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if were you would not divulge word of these	114.60
come come cheer up my dear father tis really they say joy never hurts and so came to you without any	276.01
mazarin had passed very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against	201.04
and the count humming an air from went to sit down on bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his	125.96
and to be free prisoner has to pierce wall detach bars cut through floor all undertakings which patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of woman must give	468.26
at length waiting quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken carriage appeared coming at quick pace on the road of	153.07
but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos oh of many things said	61.24
in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest	292.23
he is extremely prudent and	133.19
and if the king permits me returned the gascon shall be near him always when there is danger to be	51.72
no said maximilian you shall not leave	18.72
grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered	83.54
madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to	47.90
tell your coachman to stop at the	32.14
are we not going said he this embarrassing	530.78
had artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become superior	120.85
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be	68.01
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said	30.17
artagnan was	70285.73
they don have lieutenants in felucca manned by crew of	199.21
declare to my nephew guido	309.32
as to the second reproach have heard it said that she does not love the english but an	35.94
never did gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of	422.35

the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was	44.58
milady assumed her smile of resigned victim and shook her	60.45
however she offered the cardinal laporte place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the	48.64

athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way	225.07
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his	448.61
even athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then	161.10
this time it the hour and from this moment milady waited with	107.55

prisoner repeated porthos quite	169.68
and he began to wander about the room like man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the	114.12
copyright law in creating the project gutenberg	119.51
artagnan with sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of musketeer at the expense of ten years of his	135.10
why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin	66.71
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he	38.90

the name of artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years the events which we have related in preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be model of courage address and	326.76
albert listened with the most profound	12.08

yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it mysterious story gilded by an immense	149.62
it is not at all amusing here there is not single woman	51.93
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal	129.93

thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and	60.42

avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to	69.85
hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the	85.66
artagnan looked attentively at the	81.24
enough enough what is your name shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to	202.93

note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the	115.34
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities	116.03
sire fear it is more than plot fear it is	24.93
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwell desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords	131.64

we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize	39.25
this is all know but know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for	112.62
spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and fainted	70.65
danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count sort of distant recognition and with danglars free and easy	277.46
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried carbine presented arms the manner of sentinel and cried who comes there in	131.88
perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur	87.96
athos saw the movement he made step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be	139.79
that voice also was known to	51.24
monsieur does me wrong said planchet thought he had seen me at	83.74
promised him to wait replied morrel and will	20.33
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her	357.73
you ask that put your two hands	33.37
and on what have you written all this on two of my	59.64
artagnan who as gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos maxim but he did his best to keep up with his	105.36
yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass here to his health his health hurrah but the means the means said	185.66
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter gave	87.28
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the	91.65
certainly replied the jesuit little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon artagnan look full of	50.23
artagnan and the englishman chapter	34.41
villefort for declaration to be available should be made before the competent	267.69
these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least right to exact from him good reason for so	966.41
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss	160.22
you had only read line or two said artagnan read the letter again from the	105.17
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this	92.45
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the	134.49
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but revelation on her part would bring about revelation on the part of	208.80
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired	172.66
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had	114.57
he was nineteen when he entered the château if he was thirty three when he	70.01
morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the count guidance followed course of archæology mineralogy and natural	147.12
he drew out his watch and exclaimed nearly nine clock why shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight good night my	143.93
this winding sheet was nothing more than beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought fortnight	136.93
beware of what you are about gentlemen said clear voice which seemed accustomed to	74.35
meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is letter from her	79.71
artagnan bowed to the duke and was	40.69
château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had	145.46
and who told you this fine story the king	25.49
yes my lord like yourself said the queen	24.26
suffer from emotion said monte	16.45
artagnan pretended	521.69
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict	63.83
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the	32.70
what is it asked	37.70
this evening then at quarter to nine at the	39.42
each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own	45.56
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the	129.02

have you is he still amusing himself in italy believe so however he regrets your absence	124.87
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this	35.93
and he placed the bonds in his pocket	26.80
the resumed the jesuit	193.15
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he	20.75
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable distinction as the marshal baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy line of battle at	258.92
and swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with	235.45
and what shall say to the people that they must have patience said anne as	27.45
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion elbow directed his attention by his	918.93
it is great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas marshal staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly have left the service	496.68
artagnan and athos refused	33.18
in the meantime artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la	30.26
why you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	60.29
artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet	41.91
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep	166.67
you have sister asked the	13.83
madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank	147.81
danglars no longer had	78.51
the first time he saw artagnan you have come off well said he to him there is your jussac thrust paid	53.37
think that man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other	99.91
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it	25.89
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into	112.21
good bye till we meet	52.54
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the	192.47
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six	188.61
have you not slept said the	79.21
come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival leave the carriage entirely at your	33.40
avrigny with slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for will come no	124.10
am manifestly protected in most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white	325.32
château renaud and morcerf exchanged third look of still increasing	200.08
artagnan saw that the moment was	17.79
what is the matter maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your	42.55
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this	176.63
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing	25.99
then must make journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my	68.75
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine	36.13
valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her second	105.78
confess began to be very uneasy on your	44.20
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this	27.17
fernand cried mercédès believed you were good hearted and was mistaken fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes will not deny it do await and do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate will tell you that he died loving me and me	262.24
am watching said	22.69
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no	110.66
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont	100.91
ah said monte cristo did not expect that the affair would be so promptly	56.11
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed artagnan aside with his	39.26
it is only the dead who do not	36.45
de la trémouille in whose service he had relative artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out exchanging some words with artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the	250.40
took the mule and the horse for what he owed us he assured me that they were two noble	98.42
oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then he did not credit it at the period which knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does	198.47
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the	33.46
from seven clock in the morning crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the	74.02
four men surrounded him besides the	120.03
the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten	39.64
yes said the duke smiling and even believe that know that other person it is my lord have not named her interrupted the young man	66.36
the others	278.18
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever	1780.08
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this	237.50
can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	62.62
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no	72.56
monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket	253.52
what next my friend you impose painful task on	119.79
the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now	37.80
this time artagnan was not	101.10
they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and would lay down my life for	102.89
de saint méran madame de saint	6.62
or the mysterious benefactress said	508.28
did you come here sir to see the telegraph he	16.05
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your	130.10
once knew bragelonne is he still alive no sir he is dead and believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which take my	156.06
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came	102.39
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext	88.78
eighteen leagues is enough for the first	84.98
porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to artagnan to the great astonishment of the young	24.39
what you scoundrel have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven no monsieur we keep him in the cellar you do not know what he is about in the	59.76
man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new comers contemplated	95.51
eugénie became	564.16
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the	101.98
their number was	113.50
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow single soul of us to set foot in the	201.27
what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite	444.86
madame said the young man bowing can refuse nothing asked of me	33.26
my prisoner he	50.54
come and will explain to	30.09
de winter shook him by the	34.46
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that question can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as did not know when might again come to paris	139.93
it was estimated at fifty thousand	192.97
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to holy indignation you pious man you who are called just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and will	366.49
six clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven clock dinner was ready and served	79.76
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be	56.05
and without losing minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within wedding	637.24
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for	80.72
well then said artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	36.66
by musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the	30.53
they heard the horsemen pass under the	27.15
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was sou left in her	372.45
certainly might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my	579.61
won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then lost	119.80
the procurator wife shed	66.13
where is the count friend lead me to	11.49
would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did not possess moral distrust of my best friends and sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule should as the actors say be playing part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of	412.54
all hands to the pumps shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came	132.72
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father will	89.21
listen to	35.13
you have doubtless heard the adventures	7.10
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her	228.74
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved was set at	63.39
returned last night and here	43.77
your mother your sister who will support them shudder ran through the young man	87.26
then resting his foot on small ledge he made sign to show all was	119.17
aguillon his mistress and	60.33
that is	114.65
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him the reduction of paris to assume for his arms golden lion passant upon gules with the motto et	643.08
artagnan alone was calm at least in	67.47
as captain of the	338.55
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the	36.81
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his	49.49
what was most clear in the matter was that artagnan loved milady like madman and that she did not love him at	79.76
my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their	175.62
follow us at distance of twenty paces as far as the louvre and if anyone watches us slay him artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm allowed the duke and	173.06
but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to	41.39
he placed himself at the table and wrote little note which he sealed with ring and gave the billet to	41.88
artagnan my	24.91
how many men does your eminence wish to escort you you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord	199.55
had such uniform as your eminence possesses protest should be mightily content and would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night adventure don suppose my dress would have been very safe	524.24
for pity sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pity sake do not call assistance save me will not harm	132.80
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal	104.97
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your	26.62
was where artagnan	154.19
then she knew that he was one of the friends	14.99
artagnan artagnan cried athos my son entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let man die without extending hand to save	80.21
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until more favorable	102.56
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal	422.56
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left	182.40
well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemy	42.17
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask single	162.37
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it	109.30
alas sir replied the queen have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making	44.90
progress of cavalcanti the younger	124.74
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found resting place in his	538.94
grimaud is well bred	324.35
no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month am tormented by	53.87
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated	422.23
from la rochelle and you from	53.50

prisoner at vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for broussel good god what then is to become of royalty the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting	627.44
shake hands crave your	5036.04
really pray tell me all about it for it must be	38.13
almost an impossibility replied the	424.99
well said	257.66
this was man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen coachmen on cold night and in the summer he made point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the	237.47
milady looked around her as if in search of	70.35
was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the	39.56
inquired franz the countess had second time directed her at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in living	195.02
to saint peter first and then to the colosseum returned	65.33
all three remounted their horses and set out at good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing	307.29
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he	74.15
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	248.42
it is so hot at marseilles that really believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing	209.50
endowed with rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest	146.80
at five clock anne went to the cardinal	18.19
love your devotedness said	61.43
od bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered had almost given you	46.40
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected	45.86
on his return to the cathedral artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the	72.97
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of	595.93
father you know very well that the general was not man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of	92.70
artagnan needs to be alone to weep and to	73.10
but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès for myself want	35.13
oh mon dieu it is matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the	102.72
why didn the baron come himself demanded	28.57

athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the	45.59
project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected	41.42
woman you have assassinated woman then cried the	65.39
he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the	286.69
afraid of making any inquiries at this house artagnan entered small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for cup of	85.07
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these	167.59
ah ah cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs aramis darted at artagnan one of those looks which inform man that he has acquired mortal	273.62
precisely so cried monte cristo precisely so and this is what said to my worthy	56.01
artagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time have written to you to tell you that love	40.13
you meddle with politics do you and still more with cardinalist politics why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the	108.71
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the	108.77
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road	69.55
lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the	123.43
de tréville how the affair came to	37.53
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors the former life of the prisoner his transformation review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that knowledge of human life could furnish to mind like that of the	197.18

my faith everything considered you are very well off	55.65
this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an	513.19
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time	40.31
delirium he repeated delirium do you say oh no remember too	77.85
and now said athos what is to be done have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur herblay and myself to do in your	43.25
dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard arm he would not die by what seemed an infamous	205.21
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti not so mademoiselle eugénie	60.09
everything conspired to prove to artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that great misfortune had	128.88
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her	183.99
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the	111.79
are the carbines loaded yes	103.13
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his	30.18
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother	137.62
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the night light held it up as if to test its	228.60
is there indeed my good fellow pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz	113.62
let us wait by all	25.81
what for five years he had been wanting faithful servant friend helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the	177.52
alas dear mother said the young man have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of	54.16
franz épinay and she shall marry	34.68
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against	44.66

his brain was on fire and life and energy	54.11
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	51.30
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	167.35
he entered by the faubourg	7.35
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	46.93
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind curtain and turned	70.79

danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed	248.82
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his	175.19

peppino was handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would	155.90
still as five clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his	111.00
alas murmured he with intense suffering might then have been happy	45.69
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his	94.98
at this word athos and aramis jumped	39.25
the antechamber	19.77
could not contain himself and he made step toward the queen apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless	214.79

and charmed it	442.98

it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was	61.42
my dear count said albert will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be	224.06
albert understood the allusion in moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of challenge held him	239.00
and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this	56.69
at bourges yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles	109.85
artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such paradise then he shook his head saying if were porthos and artagnan came to make me such proposition as am going to make to him know what should say to	262.90
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued artagnan with his frank	76.55
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real	124.20
the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert prison and franz and the count followed	53.93
and that is the only reply you make alas	56.17
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already	79.61
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at	410.52
let me conduct your business and my	37.27
ah ah said	116.73
bonacieux was going that was to follow	15.91
they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were	371.99

the most important thing was not to kill him only for had an opportunity of doing so hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being	132.38
noirtier eye bade her	136.64
well at few minutes to seven at few minutes to seven cried la ramee cold sweat upon his	118.93
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count am quite sorry not to have met you	295.67
their connection could not last long without ruining	331.16
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not good man man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off joke but your excellency has not read	258.87
artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of	117.19
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	53.72
will your majesty deign to excuse me speak sir speak boldly replied	121.51
beauchamp looked at albert with benevolent	30.83
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for	370.16
thought had been deceived had mistaken the	29.51
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other	78.29
oh feel easy replied	44.21
de chevreuse who though exiled to tours and believed to be in that city had come to paris remained there five days and outwitted the police the king flew into furious	200.45
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking single word until he had	92.80
and he struck his breast with his emaciated	268.29
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your	192.67
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if had employed it for another purpose should bring on me disgraceful	307.04
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of	272.55

now said the king give the word and let us	42.77
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one	146.49
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in week shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and	385.77
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen	16.61
mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain	125.20
and madame de villefort and sometimes confess have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our	86.70
the first named malefactor will be the second	137.90
is that monte cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in melancholy	42.19
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it was looking for frightful discharge of musketry which would crush	263.78
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god	356.88
what is that inquired the	36.24
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very	31.46
it was there lodging was prepared for	23.71
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of little pocket book with golden clasps remnant of his old fancies or perhaps tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book note of	439.20

at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to	54.41
your majesty mind may be quite at ease replied the officer have my answer	36.46
behind the head of the bed and concealed by stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was hollow space and in this space ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in	203.07
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of contract should occupy so long time without unexpected	209.28
that is slight difficulty said porthos and good push with the shoulders for god sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they	220.39
bring them	372.66
well well	34.31
that difficult replied	16.73
come am growing an old woman said the duchess	58.70
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods	250.87
what rival foi what rival why your	1250.63
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and	139.01
that was no reason for staking my diamond replied artagnan closing his hand with nervous	219.28
should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with	33.63
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the	232.72
in saying these words artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and	105.76
these words of felton passed like ice through her	197.04
monte cristo had seen	529.21
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by	43.01
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	84.37
my dear athos wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for	68.85
he answered therefore think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when was in his	149.00
see said she if everything does not second us here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	223.98
de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday	29.38
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my	134.98
did she afterward return yes but only to take little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again	159.87
wait wait said the	35.98
very and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists asked	230.14
lift it and judge if am	48.17
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my	55.57
asked you if you knew him extremely	29.23
oubliettes are employed as means of kingly vengeance and low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to	194.59
have replied artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	69.79
well here am proving at once that am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that	106.44
do you possess that right over bertuccio	68.41
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your	105.25
think of it madame he said if on my return justice has not been satisfied will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her eye alone lived and glared	377.00
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire	299.61
yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and	74.82
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not	52.13
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white	120.20
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in	41.01
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as	163.60
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down narrow staircase	37.14
artagnan rattled the gold in his	183.97
now then said artagnan this is something like this is means of	60.75
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and	129.53
this evening said the	349.92
de monte cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to	53.95
but hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful	86.73
what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the	110.37
dessessart ought to be his	52.39
this is what propose to do said	18.48
the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed de combat_ in cabaret squabble you don do your work by	184.83
when you spoke to me of experiencing vague and indefinite sense of coming danger placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged	539.99
the result was that even if the king troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the	171.71
italy sinbad the sailor	29.99
well go and fetch them and come to my	30.16
oh yes and with all my heart for know what it is to be in	34.61
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer	289.55
then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron do not know him returned monte cristo but shall probably soon make his acquaintance for have credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at	260.60
so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an	207.03
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	352.42
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte	96.48
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard	149.88
then artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre respectable looking house and this artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy	273.06
will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to	57.48
artagnan ran	30.16
so now breathe again am happy don be in haste to celebrate victory porthos interposed artagnan never have we incurred greater danger than we are now	572.06
suspicion instantly seized	47.20
he could not see it but he its	38.59
de monte cristo purchased house at auteuil certainly for he told	33.56
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards	81.13
thank you	1371.34
ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris why so on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so	163.61
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard	52.48
used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were	131.59
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery	39.47
as for me answered porthos wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into barony with promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates	438.02
thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until	31.53
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under	95.92
aramis must have worn himself to shadow of his former self by constant	143.55

benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have since that day either seen or heard anything concerning	247.83
they did not dare to ask him how he had	58.10
and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was	176.70
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite	46.69
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their	557.09
can work then said the	132.63
almost immediately bertuccio entered the	34.03
he stopped at short distance from the house and	47.58
no for that very resemblance affrights me should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of	638.75
artagnan received him as he would have done friend of twenty years	53.88

the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis glow of pleasure lighted his pale	176.71
men fear him and spare	12.43
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make hasty	164.81

albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like pythoness evoking spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with	335.56
villefort looked for an instant with gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one	233.77

grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without	146.45

there was evidently severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his	205.57

what are you waiting for said	20.62
silence cried the gascon do not utter that	12.33
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis and quarter of an hour having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of	112.46

and what does it concern then my captivity heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else attached no more importance to that event than it	225.02
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not	184.55

stepmother is never mother	29.94
if you take one step farther artagnan said he we shall cross swords	83.42

grimaud fell precipitated into the	399.11
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed	86.12
avrigny in the same pitiless	83.09
what is that madame	62.58
sob was the only sound he	42.56

it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoy weak	436.62

but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he	41.15
well then we will put simply lord do you remember certain little enclosure where your life was spared my dear artagnan you will never make anything but very bad	231.64
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some	93.92
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first	33.79

it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis	80.00
true true said caderousse in choking voice was	71.56

morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected	199.65

we have fallen in with party of	56.47
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless	149.86
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of	83.10

although artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal	245.14
procureur you must go farther	23.61
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite	192.60
to meddle in politics he exclaimed in languid voice leaning back in his easy	187.20

it is my father who has just left his	37.20
owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was prudent and rather timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make demand in favor of	273.62

and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture works but am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is poet true	135.72

parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy sire he said in low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise no how would you have me know parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his	186.68
let us get down count and examine this	73.38
the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the	11.84

but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for theatrical life and acting upon this principle the banker daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her	399.73
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive letter signed sinbad the	25.56
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin think know what you want replied	372.52
the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market	110.32
but that is not quite what mean to ask you aramis replied	25.74

my advice is this said monsieur arminges and if needs be my will that we beat	89.02
he removed his seat into corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to	286.25
he had therefore purchased vault which was quickly occupied by members of his	155.09
he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his	155.74
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability shall return to paris eugénie covered her face with her	203.09
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form pretty exact idea of position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen letter short but explicit gave him the	212.34
as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès	51.26
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut	229.40
what ails you said he at	65.28
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without moment hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and	390.07
well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis	38.04
andrea as we can see was surrounded by	52.36

phew whistled	286.01
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked deep sadness imprinted on his	109.67
this fashion is coming	26.57
who said it was crime asked villefort with last	69.77
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that venture to put it second	171.44
it was evident that there was clamor and	495.49
yes but on one condition that we begin by the	53.35
you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness you killed that woman alas have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when saw her when recalled all the evil she had done to me to you what could she have done to you come tell me she had seduced and ruined my brother	282.27
and she left the	87.70
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day these events had taken place athos not having	76.36
said valentine and own that if you have no stronger proof to give me have another replied maximilian but fear you will deem it even more absurd than the	187.52
nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest	430.13
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the	55.98
he also drank half glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert	322.53
the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of	100.68
wait an instant said the host number has two staircases inside and	254.23
they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that	174.02
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her	27.56
avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young	425.63
scarron followed their movements with glance from the corner of his	38.39

well said caderousse should have sworn that he turned to the right how treacherous wine is come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose	164.66
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to	70.15
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to	94.55
come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young	24.66
the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self	68.36
it the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow	99.90
go down athos he mistrusts you less than me and see if he be still at his	102.98
with all my	43.07
what would you have said the	20.17
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments shall find one both palpable and visible on whom shall revenge myself assure you for all have suffered during the last	528.30
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the	161.47
aramis immediately complied and sang the song in very lively	518.27
in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves	142.74
of what country are you asked the	52.10
at the left of the opening was dark and deep	28.57
there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for saw the account and copied it	153.14
gondy smiled the queen color rose and mazarin grew even	79.09
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his	54.99
we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as	49.42
well said athos don you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you question relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know	70.45
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even	99.39
his only jewellery was chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white	199.98
you will then be at my service asked	23.97

and what have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my	26.52
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole	176.30
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking fowling piece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into love of sport or desire for	387.50
but no said valentine no tell you it is all past and it was	25.32
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the	234.22
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and	88.72

my son said the abbé you who are sailor and swimmer must know as well as do that man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty	156.89
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands	132.46
and it is not yours no she is bordeaux vessel gironde_ she comes from india also but she is not	125.17
the fool the ass the idiot how so if he loved her asked	82.37
this second part of his discourse fixing his hawk eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his	310.92
she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her	103.70
at this time athos came up to	35.04
come just acknowledge that could eh this address was accompanied by look which was by no means difficult to	116.17
what number was it that rang	20.16
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood	54.77
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to	34.07
well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the	39.52
the shadow of cloud passed over aramis face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape artagnan	253.72
then give me that letter madame said the	62.77
stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his	67.16
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as am in search of woman who added he with terrible smile must have passed this way for see	149.94
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him	372.98
still another obstacle murmured	129.99
oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very	40.79
sell this ring ring which comes from my sovereign never said	72.53
how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea assure you have never given the subject thought but suppose it must have been at least two	84.68
if when you have seen me again you still persist well then you shall be free and myself will give you the weapon you	144.09
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in formidable	242.77
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of	425.49
de sable	7301106.10
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear	18.49
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant	43.43
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within hundred paces of the	80.91
oh no no said the general smiling faintly did not come for that purpose you are	61.44
then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into	106.41
albert was	65537.00
and if it were an interrogatory replied the	115.68
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother jewel	464.70
do not jest about holy things my	64.10
monsieur de beaufort he is at	78.53
we must pierce through the corridor by forming side opening about the middle as it were the top part of	90.07
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at	40.18
then he took away his mother portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and	211.26
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such	95.97
is he not the son of general épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba the	53.21
well said aramis beaten by fate beaten said	22.64
artagnan grew pale with	61.47
then gloom settled heavily upon	275.40
the part of an honest man full of courage and real	108.20
mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of	29.19
oh said artagnan this is rather warm it appears that milady and are anxious about the health of the same	44.19
at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of splendid mirror on rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on chair at the side was laid the rest of the	245.33
and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil will return tomorrow said	178.89
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse	57.82
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted	136.01
aramis colored	227.26
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the horses are	72.42
artagnan lifted up his	41.97
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now believe in paris sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three	94.19
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of	50.27
bonacieux opened the door of closet which was entirely dark and led artagnan into	25.90
milady held out her arms her wrists were	93.38
well let say no more about	11.96
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not	42.05
shall speak to him you know how much he loves me my	28.86
are you french sir said he to	42.40
could not see the expression of his countenance but felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was	39.54
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos artagnan became hourly more in love with	220.33
where is her stepmother do you know she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving	96.70
and not at all said	58.58
sir said franz regret much that such question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds	201.91
and as artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for	45.67
porthos rose always ready for this kind of	78.68

will warn	115.47
well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow before tomorrow that will be difficult matter to arrange besides shall just be in the way of all the preparations for	112.30
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the	42.87
to tell the truth count if knew less of you should think that you were less brave than you	39.44
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too	234.43
there was moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave kick against the door enough to split	309.28
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or	231.42
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his	112.54
yes there were some people on the way who delayed	47.02
and now said artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard hope you are going to let me into your	91.85
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil	120.54
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at	35.43
the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the	167.92
artagnan sank on his knees and	37.69
had prepared it beforehand for am much in want of money	105.13
but you do not know this	24.16
well asked	414.16
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which coffee the guests at breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the	632.49
it was evident that he shared his master	100.66
he drew kitty to	17.79
my lord he has been for three days at the rue	37.35
franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in sphinx like	185.86
madame danglars had started when villefort on the count invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his	89.23
so saying he leaped into boat desiring to be rowed on board the	327.04
the telegraph	83.64
absolve you cried the priest with laugh which made the dying man hair stand on end absolve you am not	55.41
noirtier acknowledged by look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from	396.11
as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker lips turned alternately red and	81.24
madame have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested shall be forced to	92.18
small white cloud which had attracted dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the château	62.06
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible	63.47
no doubt his ideas were arranged in few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful	154.94
shall you be happy if do what you wish oh yes valentine mounted on bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the	137.67
the devil said	5.23

but tell me valentine how has it all been effected what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time will tell you all about	258.04

artagnan bowed and went	12.67
artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister finger that	196.42
rich richest my dear fellow and artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his	95.81
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four	95.72

danglars is money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight	163.80
coquenard understood	36.49
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old	79.79
it was human storm made up of thunder of cries and hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and	450.36
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his	77.23
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new	91.68
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of	137.74
my dear albert replied franz am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain most erroneous notion concerning italian	408.17
but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before give you an	237.33
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with force which he fancied would prove	112.60
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two	77.36

the count	110.62
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her	453.98
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with	65.63
now what you told me this morning of your heart may believe well count replied morrel gayly will not dispute	190.39

the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged	64.56
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past	366.43
the patron shook his	4.37

oh command and will	34.30
besides he said treasure is not thing we need hurry	50.22
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the	434.54
you knew the poor lad then continued	32.46

my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you why did not expect to see you before	106.57
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil the steward emotion had continued to augment as they entered the	102.15
hasty actions are generally bad	246.73
and yet replied artagnan think recognize the	46.66
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the	31.78
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you priest should not dare tell you that but you are man and you know	104.12
cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and am very glad that have not any children for if were father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying should throw myself into the sea at once for could not bear	290.13
artagnan thought this was the moment to	52.36
do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does did she not love an englishman my friend she is	65.96
you ask what god is	54.93
dead on the scaffold condemned by	21.60
the count in taking leave of him said something in low voice to which he answered willingly count	113.50
fernand looked at them both with stupefied air but did not say	33.49
the balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck	33.17
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible	153.15
what do you mean added	39.37
on both sides loud cries arose on the one side cries of anger on the other cries of	79.38
la mazzolata	1065877.22
send him away and all will then be	27.78
let us return	23.30
this knife was my only	57.92
this fortress was his post as king attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by	303.77
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of	377.82
they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was	66.01
he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but certain juvenile modesty restrained	370.06
what shall we do what are we going to do faith it is not very difficult to	58.83
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the	147.35
at this	24.92
and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville no madame for presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of	156.27
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each	48.03
come he said it is only veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of	155.74
have care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when in my turn may require your aid and	278.34
he should have waited for me here with cabriolet till half past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone	118.92
then arrive crowd of policemen and	2229.78
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds man as to felton he	751.60
you have once before thrown yourself in my	36.43
hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty example and not get killed for your folly in this	117.21
no said she withdrawing it gently no my friend touch me	87.64
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched	87.27
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at later	383.59
madame de villefort remained immersed in	362.23
and where does he come from asked	26.20
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness secondary cause but not the	216.55
well asked	19.61
and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by woman do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing man in brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon tofana_ well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her	786.32
oh exclaimed	518.88
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended	74.20
smile of terrible import passed over the count	124.13
villefort and avrigny exchanged	77.75
was taken to versailles for three months struggled with death at last as seemed to cling to life was ordered to the	200.58
the queen	1407.04
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count carriage stopped at the	65.75
and then have thought that considering three months lodging about which have said nothing yes yes you have already given me that reason and find it	117.44
this time we were the vultures so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general	201.81
what do they do try to spend it	42.23
can leave you alone in this abominable	299.51
the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to	89.08
as luigi spoke thus he left	18.90
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the	80.46
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the	163.10
no one must disturb us he said must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his	154.50
danglars let us go	54.09
it is casket of wood bound with iron thought	117.93
it was nothing but plan of attack against the	66.76
hush said porthos	55.50
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond cell for the purpose of cutting peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in tone indicative of great	355.92
but let me see how was it done speak said the	32.57
have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as father for am too young but as an elder	138.52
fie madame fie said porthos as if	88.25
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of little door almost hidden in the	66.19
here am back again and we are going to be	35.59
the moment is at hand he	7.82
why replied dantès see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by	433.96
he wished to call out to him but could not utter	32.67
and so my dear count said artagnan his eminence didn actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and who have insisted and even in manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see	275.08
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his	80.33
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer	60.96
grimaud followed	28.98
we are to meet our friends at the hotel at	33.49
why so your eminence might be	42.87
and me too said	16.57
had no doubt he would return the following	16.09
do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of	168.78
well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of	56.85
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of minister more powerful than the king	69.80
and this explains how artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la	40.51
he beat retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him	313.44
well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and hundred charges to	286.80
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you truly she might have thought of you at	107.85
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of	57.48
then he bowed second time and	24.98
yes for the mother sake his poor mother cried the major taking third	123.44
mazarin replied artagnan bursting into	92.19
we have before stated that all the servants had	55.13
refer to your	432.28
the only question was had she ten or twelve at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the	64.67
well there just the man we want said	13.36
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin	232.04
de morcerf approached	25.67
you mentioned fowl think yes	67.27
what was his name the abbé	24.33
am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is	75.91
but they could discern nothing but man of middle height dressed in black apparently of certain age for the end of gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his	177.19
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no hundred times no then you did not bury the poor child there sir why did you deceive me where did you place it tell me where there but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon	285.73

lucien inquired	54.96
his next act was to purchase dog from one of his	100.96
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped	91.81
but you will remain you are not afraid said artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his	96.90
this was too much for the procurator wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and	54.09
and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as	128.84
but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well think may venture to ask you this	79.37
the editor was reading with apparent delight leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably composition of his	334.02
must aramis do as much as madame said artagnan deeply	121.54
yes understand perfectly said	17.41
he resembles his	59.11
do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we	233.30
allow me to introduce my friend baron de château renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom have just learned that you were spectator of the races in the champ de mars	308.96
what do you mean the album want the	8.74
alas resistance was far from my	23.07
well he will do more than he has	33.33
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite	171.02
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed oh my wound mine tis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see cavalier who makes inquiries about young man on chestnut horse followed by servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at	344.12

when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of	122.24

oh his name his name cried	57.45
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail five minutes it was down and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant	298.55
indeed replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well	72.42
it happened however that the second soldier was swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos	341.09
on the left in sort of valley he perceived circular	203.43
remembered him	3772.38
bridle in mouth said	10.77
it was not without foundation that report of the king intention to leave paris by night had been	68.51
alas he said am then to die you are going to kill the son as you killed the mother surely if am culpable and if ask for pardon ought to be	62.98
and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned	81.91
franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman	123.59
to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with	294.44
you can come he said and led them back to	60.34
oh make yourself easy am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what	108.08
parliamentary officer clothed in black and with gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their	508.22
between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of	127.25
we are always in hurry to be	44.03
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in	90.05
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of	771.54
ah cried the cardinal thought you were gascon my friend am gascon said only when	40.85
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical	541.51
have told you that was traveling on an important	146.85
no replied artagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes can see what other people cannot	106.20
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his	78.83
but where can wait oh there is no difficulty in	36.58
and madame de villefort charming	94.37
that assassination was mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one	295.72
artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed	75.46
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him	53.15
the expulsion took place and pocketed francs the day	800.50
ah have you your sword athos cried	21.07
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his	16.94
ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward artagnan and am truly pleased to meet	86.22
and that is the reason why have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon false account believe us to be in	83.38
my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not	159.62
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as	74.13
and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the	53.21
on yourself then unhappy man on yourself am the only guilty person am not said	76.26
his musketeers proceeded and followed	45.05
faith you are indeed right not to return to	35.16
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew	78.79
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced	360.09
five millions pretty sum eh peppino hush here is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door	269.49

he then rolled them separately and put them in hat which he handed to	94.17
de tréville it had	265.64
how much asked	63.10
one window was	215.41
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventy five pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the	186.26

if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase phaeton go to baptiste for	464.60
this person sailor of turbulent character and whom suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of	254.97
her face is very pale and have listened in vain do not hear her	88.14
well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his	393.47
artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend complete	225.17
as we pass from one room to another will open the windows to let you	87.55
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of	133.23
villefort went himself to find her and avrigny approached	32.59
the glance was of sublime	518.75
and he pointed his gun at artagnan who was riding toward him at full	58.94
this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution thought should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the	267.47
but let us return to	31.35
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go	62.88
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at private staircase of the kiosk where was scene of frightful tumult and	503.90
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made cardinal they are soliciting the hat for	95.32

now would anybody think that this room contained happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be	456.90
yes and take your brother with	14.29
the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and light appeared through the panes of the outside	75.22
congratulate you many long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me so you see in what situation	159.94
de villefort communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place	195.46
once upon time there lived queen powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too	245.73
our house added the englishman with laugh does not do things in that	40.58
at the mention of the monk grimaud became	21.74
thus was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the	323.93
de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling	173.64
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and	123.05
none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an	147.41
yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him	141.11
well his love is half real half	123.88
artagnan said the minister sitting down am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that minister can give an	78.31
avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and	71.03
the duke uttered cry but grimaud did not give single	63.44
because was shown up the private	25.51
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three	63.48
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come	39.96
the count eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to deadly	130.24
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their	130.07
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last long time	393.63
faria bent on him his penetrating	56.21
the count of morcerf was not person to excite either interest or curiosity in place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated	159.85
perhaps there are four said	13.68
you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts asked	208.94
she will repent and no one will know that she has been	46.46
grimaud had stout short picard cob which cost three hundred	287.02

in the first place must be satisfied that you are the person am in search	20.27
the vendetta	2834.75
will it be the same this evening your very grateful milady clarik that all very simple said artagnan expected this	52.81
did not even wish to know her name nor do know	42.06
and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make artagnan shudder but artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt it matters little now to	351.33
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at	233.71
ah bah which whichever of the three you like have no	241.78
oh no answered franz had no such intention and even if had felt wish to witness the spectacle might have done so from monte pincio could not ah exclaimed mine host did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to	514.26
but at any rate you know where he is monsieur artagnan asked raoul somewhat	73.35
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than	82.68
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the	62.17
knew there were smugglers but thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain	368.24
how long delay do you wish for morrel	36.34
villefort dictated petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon	368.36
artagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of judge sent by the lord	117.38
two hours passed	21.92
at length journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to castle severe in form massive and	897.56
planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved profound sigh and set to work to groom the third	190.70
the englishman was an original had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his	84.96
and where is it on the first	26.00
well said	82.86
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to	101.26
athos was gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this	230.47
ah he is confectioner in the rue des lombards how does it happen then that he is in your service he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be	147.71
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady apartment he found her standing mounted upon chair holding in her hands cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into kind of rope one with another and tied at the	352.97

albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother	64.26
life itself may be resolved into three words est	239.41
meanwhile what of mercédès she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her	68.11
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and	180.29
the eight guards were at their	196.99
danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his	86.04
it was like having spy in the enemy	43.07
athos raised his sword artagnan lowered	18.08
what the devil artagnan is too good comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of king on his	197.57
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest	33.05
have sworn to tell you all and will tell you	39.59
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing	116.09
thinking that porthos will be at last baron and artagnan	30.27
porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his	51.72
bonacieux to join	28.76
bravo athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in	61.09
my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the	170.65
franz épinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with bitter smile am selfish you have already said so and as selfish man think not of what others would do in my situation but of what intend doing	456.32

at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging	254.36
well let us sleep at noyon said	117.99

artagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	159.00

each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of	212.55
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of	903.68

and this all knew so well that it was double victory for the court victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her	339.27
she then turned towards the	67.81

what is the use of boring one self with so many things besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as	253.94
artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed	39.11
and both again left the	27.69
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did you were too young to know about such	65.92
the valet de chambre	18.51

that emetic villefort see if it is	174.14
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our money sum at which most assuredly should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with laugh that no prophet is honored in his own	746.52

de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving artagnan response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country double remembrance which makes man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making sign to artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry	434.93
follow him said	9.01
you see do not conceal	100.71
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on chair saying my god thank thee that he knows me	227.31

the queen was ignorant where the mercer young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure	88.97
one said the grave diggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like wounded bird falling falling with rapidity that made his blood	182.27
yes that first and other things	48.10

well then go wait for me there and will soon join	21.33
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his	63.52
while reading this letter artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of	326.46
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to	169.58
sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you	41.90
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other	226.19

then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two	83.38

then suddenly how should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said	87.33
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his father	186.49
and he threw away his	102.12
egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as	258.65

but presently the exempt face suddenly	878.19
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo course of cross	253.27
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such formidable	1191.92
we should be very hard to please madam returned albert did we not think him	222.15
oh no our breakfast comes from my father	70.53

the storm still	85.33
half past seven had	54.54

madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the gave her few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to	134.93
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed	56.04
zounds said artagnan that settled already will be responsible for the	71.56
anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that artagnan presented to	23.97
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in	135.98
the king procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of	65.14
on going home the two friends found letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following	71.65
you are	3046.71
it may be supposed then franz did not wait for repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in tunisian costume that is to say red cap with long blue silk tassel vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had splendid cashmere round his waist and small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his	508.13
there they	45.09

listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal	142.40
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his	91.88
uncertainty is still	495.09
the cardinal referred to that man whom artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor	107.10
the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely	324.26
ah exclaimed avrigny in voice in which the horror of judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of student making	189.87
thank you cried he throwing himself on his	28.49
this intelligence restored every one save athos to	107.67
that think is as much as shall	33.32
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what am to do	100.59

and when is he to be married immediately on the arrival	19.88
passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul way of riding and observed take care raoul have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is great defect in	242.86
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like	173.95
the duke went from one surprise to	17.19
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing	23.23
she is amiable and well	52.71
as artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and servant went to	165.77

evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of mother she watched for his	116.11
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow flash kindled in his eyes and bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into	224.05
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does	76.82
mon dieu said the woman crossing	40.58
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been	316.73
and now think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was	131.93
but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps	103.23

having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven clock haydée will soon be	292.50

franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either	381.23

about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with	144.87
what time is it then eh why it is one	42.09
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell	266.37
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased	53.80
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of man who appreciated their	104.21
did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile came to touch and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed	182.30
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that should give you	144.83
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano	27.98
mousqueton horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his	35.41
then said raoul this monsieur scarron is poet yes you are warned	59.68
oh meddle in nothing which concerns	19.66
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron	128.11
bonacieux rising all in tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid	126.19
devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till knew them nearly by heart so that since have been in prison very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before	664.60
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and made you sign in order that you might hold yourself in	106.54
oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give	227.64
are not you the person who brought me letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf your excellency lodges at pastrini hotel	92.01
so once more good	49.63
in game of tennis asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke	85.80
undoubtedly the call came from faria	72.75
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the	156.25
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which have always	161.53
we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his	208.65
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint	268.46
we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than	205.73
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with little	45.67
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of	171.93
he is the cause of all this misery am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to	80.45
is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his	55.20
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed	123.61
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his	169.82
pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb	53.03
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was very knightly	204.53
man the discussion is going to begin again said	56.30
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between	105.91
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate	221.67
if they are penitent said athos let them follow	98.67
on his side however great franz desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning	165.63
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be woman of any consideration they lock her up for	570.86
the victim resisted as much as woman could resist four	86.20
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere he was brave and an honest	139.80
oh said oliver with slight curl of his lip forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been	310.87
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you frank and honorable	76.13
everything shall be done as you say	17.56
was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my	54.50
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the	169.73
why said château	4.18
so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first	70.85
the remembrance of milady recurred to	13.09
which your majesty will think no longer doubt my zeal in your	85.68
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her	104.81
yes know that said buckingham he has	62.89
he is afraid have come to borrow money thought	41.83
how is it concealed behind my	37.86
she is foreigner	278.53
noirtier had once made will against you against your family in favor of the poor in	56.81
then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the	45.21
he bowed with great friendship to the	20.44
what did your father tell	12.05
the interior of the musketeers chapter	35.42
but hush here comes	256.92
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said	101.95
bonacieux called long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer house had bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du	322.74
let us go on to another of his	109.51
in the vehicle was young woman and child of about seven or eight clasped in each other	64.75
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them	474.90
well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at	41.57
were her fears realized was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment she had only one day	96.88
oh very shortly madame said he but do not precisely recollect the date of the	44.97
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur artagnan belongs to the service monsieur artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he	127.13
then cried villefort was it you who	77.62
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than	227.71
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and	26.19
jackson replied	10493.78
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of	144.77
monte cristo observed it particularly and by look asked the banker for an	40.85
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such step uttered cries of	95.69
had such delightful	346.75
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir it is rich study for you who as learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this	288.51
pardon me monsieur said artagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put	30.29
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such silence and ceased to address themselves to	105.54
that will do will be	21.90
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same	183.43
do you indeed think so inquired the	42.65
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so	243.10
then sir am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of marriage contract always injures the lady more than the	163.01
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in	213.84
athos shuddered from head to	65.95
the son has been educated in college in the south believe near	82.81
merri you	721.49
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man will let the count know that you are	52.18
all crossed	304.14
are you coming morrel directly have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us visit at rue meslay	110.89
oh what an abyss what an abyss cried	53.49
to me to you to us take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have	113.03
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled	133.93
there ensued brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either	338.31
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the	93.88
hush said the captain it is	12.03
give me your arm and let us	14.55
the never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the	635.78
no do not dance but like to see others do	40.64
the nails too were turning	60.11
poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of	82.14
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for	21.63
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	32.34
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of	83.74
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to	141.07
we must seize the felucca said	31.19
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey	71.15
he shut the bedroom door him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had disagreeable	225.21
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch blood fell down	205.45
suppose you have blue ribbon in your pocket yes madame have that of the garter which king	118.62
am no relation of	43.70
monte cristo shuddered and	79.19
you too have been in england sir he said making sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue severe	173.17
but exclaimed monte cristo why was absent and why were you alone because you had been arrested edmond and were	93.55
and came sir added raoul gazing at the count with smile of real affection for thought you would be glad to see me	76.62
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of horseshoe and then as readily straightened	114.16
every one according to his nature my dear	32.80
albert and château renaud exchanged second look more full of amazement than the	55.94
athos and artagnan watched their approach from the	72.53
artagnan artagnan cried she is it you this way this way constance constance replied the young man where are you where are you my god at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to shock rather than opened several men rushed into the	146.80
simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off two year	402.83
when in house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held	113.96
it was superb moonlight	580.22
ah my dear count you are far too	71.32
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier expression than by valentine	90.18
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses	28.24
moreover something had been said of marriage with mazarin	99.32
this is indeed the reason why begged you to alter the order of the	68.10
no felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and feel what it must cost	53.92
at length discovered that he went mysteriously to	120.06
oh if such thought could present itself would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored	155.23
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he	110.37
this key was furnished with small iron point negligence on the part of the	127.43
about that	14711.76
am to say what you told me asked	35.70
hope have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here	39.47
ah indeed said	16.71
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the	132.48
yes said morrel it is true have but now left house where death has just entered to run to	127.99
and the steamboat she is at châlons	111.18
are you sure of what you assert what do you mean by that question understand sir do not in the least suspect your veracity ask if you are certain of it knew his	93.31
and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the	68.23
the footman mission was an easy	38.23
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to	244.67
oh yes said château	5.42
we have forgotten to mention that the count coachman was attired in bear skin exactly resembling odry in bear and the pasha_ and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who	536.01
it was ten clock when they	16.78
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter it is with that we have to do	26.97
athos had even gone so far as to	50.30
at last mastered my	36651.67
why should but still there are some signals only addressed to	42.85
that evening had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them second time with	261.16
presentation indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates	89.28
bonacieux where art thou do not leave me you see am dying artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	167.27
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear	204.29
now if you will come on	24.93
artagnan then perceived thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and	292.66
at last they reached the tennis	54.48
you will see the count again to morrow	22.90
he extended his hand and rang the bell	23.55
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles	307.43
there are yet five days left five days are more than	41.98
now to supper said	69.54
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon so much the better they must be good animals	113.77
incorruptible murmured artagnan am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind	122.18
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of	55.98
by whom by banker of paris my	104.25
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too	87.94
