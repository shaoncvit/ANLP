two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person declared could exculpate me if he	328.50
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one	361.03
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	189.64
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire	259.81
and what did monsieur artagnan reply monsieur artagnan promised me his assistance but soon found out that he was betraying	203.86
thank you said the young	6.63
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the	215.62
you are wrong	66.84
never once doubted your doing	1301.46
when he arose second time he was fifty paces from where he had first	222.88
should hate and despise myself as coward did desert the brave fellow in his present	1104.68
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter	247.77
silence said artagnan pressing her hand still more	214.67
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such war as that will restore you to liberty this moment will proclaim you piece of immaculate virtue will name you the lucretia of	267.81
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king	252.64
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to	699.10
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound	158.01
aramis affected laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out few words carelessly as he moved through the	295.00
but have nothing to fear while have you to protect	147.40
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at little village which was situated at the other side of the	127.30
pardon you for the death of poor felton pardon you for the attempts upon my own	137.39
now am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say	428.27
thank you said edmond with friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of	214.16
it was however necessary to affect weakness and pain not very difficult task for so finished an actress as	911.06
but four hundred what listen cried	400.90
exactly replied	222.82
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his	403.78
no monsieur and yet recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but	173.35
artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another	278.18
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind voice beside him said respect to fallen	392.67
thus for instance don you in the first place want horse yes	463.55
our former life has it still no attractions for you would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth do you propose to me to do so artagnan decidedly and	254.30
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think am going to change the life lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive volley of bullets all to earn paltry sum why have as much money as want mother assunta always furnishes me when ask for it you see that should be fool to accept your	452.90
this man might all be greater scoundrel than you have thought	439.55
but what if were mistaken shudder passed over	342.09
de tréville clock three quarters of an hour but thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon	141.20
no sir said artagnan and we place ourselves at your	86.23
let us consider first the ancient	1012.07
the notary who was at the door immediately	67.32
it is true that when man possesses young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness	397.51
what is he contriving asked	200.72
and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied	211.92
the miserable villain he had foreseen	850.21
shall be at home till midday or if not will leave receipt with my	500.25
tell you the queen does not love me tell you she loves another tell you she loves that infamous buckingham why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke arrest the prime minister of king	280.01
but where shall go meanwhile is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you no can trust	518.64
in fact porthos did not appear for scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going	274.93
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert	734.42
benedetto the count son replied monte cristo astonished in his	68.17
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in quarter of an hour when voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him	181.56
de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the	90.16

in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality	606.23

now valentine firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring	168.34
at the royal arms of england you will find young gentleman named	274.90
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of	243.39
there ought to be some money in that secretaire there may	98.46
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in	220.49
when you wish to obtain some concession from man self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound	274.93
and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of	428.85
debray said château	42.72
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his	663.27
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his	601.81
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their	309.51
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of	208.97
at this moment the boat came to landing with violent	203.74
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be	148.46
but at daybreak he	1026.30
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in	389.99
indeed monseigneur responded the mercer have heard her pronounce all those	728.97
the host stood at the	49.39
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from	469.21

but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the	389.15
terrible idea however rushed into her	362.41
oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do what to do there would be very simple means very natural tell me what to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	182.27
did you not yet know me come louise let us talk of our	121.60
tell you that you know these things as well as do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as doctor and as	145.47
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring full tide of silvery	608.94
edmond you have very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my	142.87
he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence four for	299.43
as for himself he dismounted and remained under beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on table which he found there conveniently	651.97
artagnan in his fortieth	1097.44
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right artagnan mouston will do mouston has very fine	375.42
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and	241.13
to give your majesty reply to those who await	163.16
corbleu let the civil war last but one year and will have constable sword gilt for	837.06
and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how tréville you know how delight in accounts of war and	268.35
this affair seems to me to have decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of great internal	367.56
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried artagnan you were all in the plot then and really don know what prevents me from exterminating you	732.89
and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said	79.33
hold your tongue imprudent man do you wish to destroy me you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since single word makes you tremble and you confess that if that word were heard you would be	164.54
wait my dear sir wait moment for have such delightful note on the quum traheret_ wait and will listen to you	506.69
let us go said she place full confidence in you my friend artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered artagnan	262.36
tell you marquis my fortune is made if only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service do	205.95
said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this	61.67
how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy thought dear valentine have not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas and you have am sure the fullest confidence in my	364.47
morrel had to pay within half an hour	302.70
the youth dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the	602.46
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his	116.14
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty	219.52
well all said artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other	164.27
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is	133.90
but as to free will aramis how acts the judge he has free will yet he fearlessly	1094.16
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	326.66
noirtier room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old	211.17
at that moment burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	401.65
morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in coach with six	1148.72
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen	210.13
yet the great sometimes repent of their	981.11
god who can read my heart all the gratitude feel will reward you save my husband save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when may be able to thank you	176.73
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was morrel who served in the same regiment with me when was in garrison at	331.12
yes returned artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the	209.30
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door	467.38
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost	228.28
oh yes it is you indeed from what he has told me know you	59.50
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that benefactor had arisen from the grave to save	355.58
adieu then edmond have nothing more to ask of heaven have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you	137.98
violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell	316.62
it had now become weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of	740.48
franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this	180.90
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count	188.98
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken	351.29
have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of	83.74
very well what did say to you that mazarin was contemptible and that wouldn serve	271.25
am convinced that if gave him box on the ear such as gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of	242.64
that is true but he will read petition countersigned and presented by	339.31
caderousse drew deep	3893.97
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly was	283.04
well sir the rupture of blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in day not in an hour but in	293.18
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	149.36
flurry in stocks	2220.32

cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me ask you what can do have tried to make you happy man and you have turned out	161.53
chastised monsieur said artagnan the expression is	107.51
have also sent for the	245.95
artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had	1523.10
then do your best to keep our name free from	477.56
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the	447.96
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his	178.43

the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former	237.44
this was to go himself	80.08
he was less stiff than	725.09
and he assumed look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have	575.09
did you see the postscript did	176.76
have promised to escort to the académie greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her	340.68
understand he said you confess but confession made to the judges confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty the punishment exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur twice you have pronounced that word	489.04
it the same thing cried the young	51.71
but it must have	314.67
we must see what it is said	41.48
morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several	467.75
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten clock shall see what color his	399.47
circle was immediately formed around the	144.86

the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for dungeon but it is not that which wish to speak of but secret have to reveal of the greatest	262.74
tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of	180.05
felton leaned for support upon piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her	203.52
and he stepped on one side to give place to young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be	422.68
and this room he asked pointing to the captain	239.01
caderousse wrote the	722.38
caderousse more and more astonished went toward large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been	899.35
pooh said athos trying to smile in his	46.64
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of	1293.96
when awoke fresh meal was	4370.35
probably said artagnan but as he is thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his	339.21
fernand paleness appeared to have communicated itself to	644.23
one plays with anybody but one fights only with	2098.36
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des	130.42
germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom artagnan had often remarked	158.54
tilted on one side of her head she had small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with	425.04
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer	494.46
my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the	165.08
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of drowning man uttered third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his	577.92
if should disturb rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an	297.88
then that is monsieur determination undeniably my	422.73
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in bedchamber which was at once miracle of taste and of	243.39
yes yes but let us talk of this	96.27
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather relief to the indifferent to see person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with father brother or	293.40
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been	227.94
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his	69.01
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him	464.64
zounds give way at these words the man with pistol and sword raised his head but it was too	134.78
foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain am not destined to return to beaucaire	571.17
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were	289.74
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de	164.31
the two brigands looked at each other for moment the one with smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his	102.80
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of artagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis	156.65
he held out his	43.53
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	111.10
and for myself monsieur shall saddle rustaud no take more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some	1505.20
what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti	681.08
love young girl	786.43
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be	271.79
the captain	1377.59
but artagnan again shook his	107.66
you see we had each our mission said porthos mine was to guard you and am doing	275.21
the blush of pride mounted to the count forehead as this thought passed through his	259.20
here they are	233.43
made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down	183.54
the young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door them descended the rue des fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the rue des fossés monsieur le prince and did not stop till they came to the place	172.10
you may now	1103.09
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience see an abbé cuffing man then bowing to woman it must be	233.83
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if	453.39
am afraid for the king safety place yourself close to the coach door on the	272.75
but they appear to speak french with very pure accent said	320.00
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic	1161.32
encouraged by this invitation artagnan followed the duke who closed the door	97.12
besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and	652.79
he will come and visit the comte de la	34.94
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its	396.78
so suiting the action to the word artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the	209.86
the enemy army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out shelter to	607.05
and she is not to be despised in my	59.62
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with	291.96
the petition finished villefort read it	2574.99
he inquired where they were and was answered by burst of	270.62
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever	482.41
what does the animal say asked the	97.95
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in frenzy of	148.12
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first	299.28
quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised	527.24
about half past	598.43
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot	175.25
judge for yourself replied	70.51
commissary said the brigadier tread in my	367.97
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even	362.91
what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his from him was lad of fifteen replied	886.82
why all these precautions you shall	225.38
lord winter you are not the king you are my	105.75
well be it so said	125.22
they are coming full gallop the prince is with them ah he is leaving them they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going	260.02
at length they reached the tent lit lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised artagnan with trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected	279.22
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it quite so my steward transacts all this business for	157.15
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with	376.36
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee	426.54
believe it is not said	29.40
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy brow little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of beautiful deep chestnut	1124.86
every time he passed with friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real	139.10
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the	263.63
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass	136.42
have related it but once and that was to the abbé	135.07
at ten clock the king collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of	165.86

to the sword sir the sword and he jumped off his	183.12
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven clock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the	271.56

of the arabian	1155.67
thank god am not bravo and being musketeer but for time only fight when am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is lady compromised by	294.10
we are about to ascertain sire replied artagnan as he rapidly left the	91.93
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young	61.63
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don let me detain	134.08
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their	278.20
franz pondered the matter for few moments concluded that man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of good supper	536.44
still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and	574.49

perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something	338.40
felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired	254.86
as for me said planchet seem to smell from this place even most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in row by the hedge hailing our	663.08
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the	59.60
he sent us word this morning replied château renaud that he would meet us on the	96.70

then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had louis for his trouble and they went on their	163.24
villefort took chair but valentine remained standing by her father side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his	224.01
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman	1863.05
there was no answer and she continued have not seen you all	110.66
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it family name or the name of the estate or simple title believe mother it is merely	192.05

supplicate you implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be blessing for my	232.24
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of	430.30
thanks planchet thanks cried athos extending his hand to the	139.36
cannot answer for the	61.16
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	765.51
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching	135.20
she said that cried the cardinal with	109.66
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of	152.91
what monsieur you must give your recipe to	179.03
fanatic has just assassinated	648.86
do you really think so ah that would indeed be	146.48
morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at short	397.16
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that	72.49
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume warlike	535.08
jacques under verdant	42975.52
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an	230.40
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and	234.25
having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his	229.43
one by one the several groups broke	1226.91
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like forlorn hope the road to the	194.97
but peppino did not	181.32
complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an	319.59
that devil porthos is man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good	497.78
they were both aroused at seven clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought letter for	188.59
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came	224.64
joy shone in raoul eyes and he leaped lightly to his	327.07
well what have to do with that why good lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the	195.87
rely on me to procure you the other will do my	110.24
it is excellent	453.80
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full	133.45
adieu thus tis quite decided said artagnan that what have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were any other man rejoined aramis but repeat am made up of	279.02
he aimed terrible blow at artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the	363.71
you are very fortunate said athos rising wish could say as much neffer replied the swiss enchanted that man like athos could envy him	430.82
still had loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in	572.44
what shall we do said	74.72
master friquet the owner of pistol and of sword which louvieres had given him had organized company of rogues like himself and was making tremendous	838.71
sir said planchet in mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate think if am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for	129.83
am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous	327.14
to the palais royal he called	87.34
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within quarter of mile of	692.03
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary terrible meaning for the	320.27
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not	919.03
and who has seen this de lis inquired	432.89
how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for did not even know of what was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first	198.52
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one	118.48
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by framework of	282.96
shall go he said to the	43.48
and now said artagnan to the	35.44
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only loose network of volunteer	1196.56

well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that am his	104.58
this side of your chamber looks out upon kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and	1317.30
soon the two gentlemen stopped	165.01
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank	146.77
he then closed the door of the	46.33
the count watched him with feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in impartial_ who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name title of nobility and family	453.35
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own	203.80
so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are	803.09

franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant	377.86
andrea at least not as	333.59

signor pastrini remained silent short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very	222.60

sometimes dream that	575.83
ay ay said athos exchanging smile with artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like good	278.00

franz épinay observed	3339.27

at this moment patrol passed	151.58
as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some	342.21
but putting his head out of the carriage eh planchet said	124.30
you understand that interested as am in this affair cannot see it in the same light as you	108.31
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly	657.41
the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the	307.27

what do you propose to me avrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my house impossible still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be	184.48

no replied noirtier	835.79
and by what gate did they go out by the saint maur	394.11
and now am convinced said artagnan that this abduction of the queen woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in	90.52
on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydée had	653.12
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is	217.18

the baroness did not wait for repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any	146.30
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some	972.18

and on what occasion she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the	99.00
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming	202.68

but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done	721.18
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the	212.05
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes	288.64

but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed	131.75
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone	68.51
but in coming too early should be afraid of awakening your	405.94
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these	350.99

that will be	109.52
these francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and shall therefore act according to my	167.64
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an	392.24
what replied the	56.68
oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic	124.38
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in	187.70

my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work little more quietly the king wishes to get	513.68
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her	219.70

pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished really do not understand you	194.16
the dying man had signed deposition declaring benedetto to be the	895.48

anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and are under such important	315.30

his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was	294.61
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me	135.93
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife fine well grown	399.87
as all this however bore some resemblance to duel artagnan began to recover himself little by	421.77
artagnan followed the with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where artagnan had	207.24
eh your excellency everyone must	282.02
attention then athos did not lose sight of the two	104.71
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via	141.19
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this	221.93
oh mon dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest	3116.65
athos mounted more slowly speaking in low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their	201.77
by your father tomb said caderousse supported by supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of	300.26
man or woman	1712.99
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you was going to make you the offer my dear artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such	229.56
you have friend monsieur du vallon whom like much let him accompany	218.21
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady	200.78
she is poor unfortunate greek left under my	974.84
prince cavalcanti said the latter prince cavalcanti where are you andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian	357.50
bring me of water said the	64.30
as long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every	185.55
you promised me something	378.72
monte cristo seemed in	111.28
you are at liberty to	57.58
gentlemen said	10.50
you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have	227.34
sir replied anne with degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police well sir you ought to know that we no longer have police since we are no longer at	189.06
be easy on that head replied athos you know am cool	247.16
you do not understand the points of english	112.76
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur when you please said	112.91
it was	120.28
left five hundred with assunta my sister in law and with the other five hundred set off for	370.71
artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	255.50
shall go and die by his	164.73
farewell then or rather revoir_ for hope we shall meet	285.71
this would have been method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do	287.32
trial it was stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till	873.78
he arrived at this end by his persistence in	308.76
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to	172.97
strength and sagacity	1707.26
at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom quarrel were not my	175.85
each of you take horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the	154.84
own that this woman terrifies	225.82
family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal family affair concerned	519.59
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with woman he	256.94
as to his title and fortune as to that madame have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs year and the title of	199.24
that my concern will make him	314.21
porthos turned rather pale and drank off large glass of	322.44
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his	150.77
well said artagnan answer that while there remains drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor	411.36
she may have forgotten	163.31
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to sigh which sounded more like	307.86
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search his lackey than he had had the night	123.33
oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his	224.58
the letter shall be given to	97.16
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs artagnan remembered he had forgotten his	112.46
he had taken the silence of the old man for return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria so painful crisis seemed to indicate serious relapse into mental	508.64
will candidly explain the reason of both and trust to your goodness to pardon	248.10
so artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in	276.47
he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three	76.77
athos look at mordaunt	1008.51
never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	72.10
it was almost triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed	641.46
has no one owned him no one his parents are	685.72
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own	218.93
will you come said he to	47.10
ah don be angry beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and	162.06
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their	333.54
besides you forget that have ring	361.30
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives	155.06
and those of the first floor you know they are never	160.80
épinay consented to our all living together	915.55
besides she felt as we feel when storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be	258.98
excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but	292.70
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this friends answered charles sadly have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of week standing whom shall never	198.04
the same perhaps said	204.97
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to	185.31
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	170.66

hitherto have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not	2559.00

ali as my	1523.83
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the	964.52
that very simple replied	263.96
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two	5877.60
ah cried artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and have such fear that it should fly away from me like dream that pant to make reality of	190.85
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom owe my introduction to the	82.35
that all right	1542.70
doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your	201.95
yes sir continued the inspector of	158.41
artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in few minutes cahusac fell with sword thrust through his	176.71
monsieur implore you do not stay there think you are going mad bertuccio said the count	137.76
he will guess at	174.59
do what	247.72
wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the	102.43
what you one what have you done with her then if you have her no longer they have abducted her	146.30
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti	130.61
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce	149.75
well said porthos replied	26.24
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on first affair you are in great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to	284.24
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de	97.77
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his	136.44
on beholding this house artagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of	312.50
another proof that he was native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic	420.08
wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed artagnan with look of astonishment what danger am told that there is general	279.57
ah he quite another sort of person formidable gentleman	790.55
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that would mention the appointment to no one muttered	238.73
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still	442.97
de tréville that all very	118.92
ah porthos cried one of his companions don try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal	275.44
hem replied	36.32

felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	76.78
then you will lie here said	63.67
monsieur aramis is not an officer asked the queen of lord de	44.09
artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp	342.73
and you as for me am quite sure that turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers shall not find ten louis at	272.55
can tréville have set this gascon upon me he is very young but sword thrust is sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into reverie which lasted some	424.15
if man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed being who when torn from you left desolation wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with few moments of physical pain yes know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to	443.02
scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine have just had wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom little expected to see	335.77
unfasten it or will break it in said	355.37
here is what you are looking for he	37.47
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the	137.70
but this secret is not mine and cannot reveal it in this	120.10
and we say proud as gascon replied	313.10
then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been barony by my	346.21
the first three remained constantly in small waiting room ready to obey the summons of small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to	392.83
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new	167.77
my father	65.46
one day we received	553.81
oh monsieur thank you with all my	68.22

am stranger and stranger to such degree that this is the first time have ever been at	115.56
have you carriage	379.38
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault stories who present themselves unbidden at wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and	905.11
mercédès read albert while showing you that have discovered your plans hope also to convince you of my	493.88
milady uttered cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefort the demoniacal tool of his	172.29
as to the king he made no demonstration of politeness only stopping before the	203.69
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	218.26

and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great	138.93
he had not seen	68.13
what was his name asked monte	30.23
artagnan went toward very small low window just large enough to let man	566.27
certainly not replied the	31.48
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if did not know that something is going on in yonder house and he pointed to magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now	381.98

de saint méran had always expressed desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family	212.03
the same as yesterday another nod on the part of	401.69

bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper	170.75

felton had not	85.25
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed handle but that had been	506.99
indeed he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais	63.10
to certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be general of the army what do you think of the plan gentlemen admirable replied the young men in	136.74
indeed said artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your	276.90
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and	2508.37
she had son that unhappy woman	381.64
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering	232.43
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	238.97
ah sir said artagnan you have wicked	100.53
that is possible	161.02
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks	412.77
indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him	176.76
then we must fly said	95.63
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the	200.21
tell me may shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must simply propose to you choice of arms albert said beauchamp with look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and	338.06
do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said	84.06
no for	452.46
those who have once beheld such spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of wintry	1031.98
nothing is lost	130.31
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she	534.39
no returned monte cristo only	296.22
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as proof of what say here is mine in my	129.03
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was sorrow and voluptuousness torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like	807.79
your home is paradise porthos one takes no note of	1280.03
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over	392.40
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime	361.28
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend	193.44
think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that	250.49
athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head	218.49
yes my lord answered the	36.17
artagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his	796.92
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the	161.74

in the first place warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find	62.40
what without chastising this insolent boy asked the	851.98
as for monte cristo this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal	321.16
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his	199.45
bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in hoarse voice his excellency horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward	255.14
my father is king attorney replied andrea	421.57
athos chose black coat which gave him the appearance of respectable	872.65
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman am going to fight with said athos pointing to artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same	66.16
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led joyous	267.81
on my soul handsome stirrups bazin come here this	1545.94
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with	484.71

fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army	815.83

the king is alone with few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself	422.36
saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the	106.64
but when the cardinal added that not only	180.21
ah ha whispered monte cristo with smile of disappointment he is only	315.74
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded	240.89

oh do not do that excellency have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in	344.17
the count soon heard the rattling of bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the	1095.69
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following	274.12
valentine smiled but it was evident that she	71.89
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of	784.21
athos and aramis kept themselves to their	261.45
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father heart beat	249.34

the count cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his	272.63
do you then love me oh valentine he asks if love	269.17
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle	611.78
but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and	215.32
let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her	318.20

your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and am too good master to allow you to miss such chance by granting you the dismissal you	208.16
depraved as girl adulterous as wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and	976.77
it was empty and dantès emerged from the	420.53
we will describe the thing to him as consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off	146.32
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter mean that shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of	134.77
zounds exclaimed artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid let him have his say artagnan said athos with smile of sadness and	233.99
and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the	324.36
poet as am am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to	353.66

be good enough to open to me for wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet	133.71
with this design he had engaged box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate	263.33
very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality	215.66
ah is it you mordaunt said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may	137.24
but how can pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with	605.48
let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so	238.77
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to	141.19
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy	339.54
am replied the latter	417.06
to think of the parisians soliloquized artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for hundred thousand	347.83
opened the door of the ante room myself and saw you enter at the end of the	58.05
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for	53.37
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the	183.31
if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of	193.54
it appears to me that this is quite	52.30
morrel and then ran on to	243.11
presented to whom to the beautiful	234.05
antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was very good price considering that artagnan had ridden him hard during the last	413.62
de tréville request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due	562.57
villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter	238.65
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward	670.99
no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with house of my	320.23
waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often	381.56
your age repeated the	218.94
the king and his escort were no longer	88.97
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate	263.86
shall further inquiries be made shall two members of the house be sent to yanina speak morcerf did not	617.41
what is your opinion gentlemen and does	58.73
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual	620.62
understand said athos but why not porthos should have thought that his duchess oh porthos duchess is dressed by her husband clerks said artagnan	223.01
they are hot royalists said	1335.51
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer	1144.54
he was struck by sudden	256.49
we were speaking of	467.79
much obliged to you monsieur	593.43
and what is fronde inquired	364.66
thirty five	331.99
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to	159.91
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take loaf two cutlets and bottle of	421.81
mordaunt having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in deep	136.64
but humpbacked general under the cuirass the hump will not be	655.90
madame he said to the duchess have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive	121.76
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by movement of rotation explained by the persistency of	257.07
yes said	10.29
morrel my thanks are	1418.12
he made sign which understood but the king guards must have noticed it and held themselves on	205.34
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor not so loud father entreat of you for your own sake as well as	154.98
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do	128.13
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of forgotten	236.19
well do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our	264.21
just then patrol rode	1764.24
see sir replied caderousse in this corner is crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my wife testament open this book and will swear upon it with my hand on the	330.53
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in	1305.95
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of	216.72
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to	281.76
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to	102.70
he recollected the call he had made upon him the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine	131.90
they then	889.17
so then said athos offering his hand to	45.15
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police ask you what you know of	135.37
you see destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness	527.29
if when on the ship you speak single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the	196.29
lions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth	707.21
must find them within three	266.76
the news of the arrival of the had not yet reached the old man who mounted on chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his	328.67
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur artagnan will enjoy our conversation	190.59
but continued the porter he would not take	75.80

general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic	98.60
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent	805.86
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking	433.82
no it would delay me and need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me	182.95
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the	220.73
de tréville nor the musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to	227.99
as to the government of normandy replied the queen think can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal	142.20
and the troop continued their	611.53
it was caesar commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these	494.53
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in	213.17
but dress yourself	3477.17
she was stone	487.00
the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with	177.84
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he	51.50
now for the tally	3055.42
pooh replied porthos am what	103.17
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered	243.26
but recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to	361.56
come come give it to me what strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his	85.14
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said	78.55
monsieur abbé you are great	586.05
no said	20.98
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful	593.19
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his	154.93
this is the mystery said	95.08
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see	312.18
the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly	541.60
say have poor father	477.06
presently they heard milady retire to her	320.14
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something	726.35
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he	382.20
while singing milady	2823.48
and make la ramee eat the pear answered	1662.25
artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos pleasant dwelling	1089.84
yes monsieur said artagnan bowing we have had that	127.52
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or	499.05
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in	122.83
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in mid	474.55
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of	478.29
what is it you edmond back again said he with broad marseillaise accent and grin that displayed his ivory white	616.44
noirtier said avrigny am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to	188.94
let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat	415.62
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the	174.94
ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe thought it was for something	216.02
now resumed grimaud ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest	293.71
saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to	358.27
there is no doubt they went thither to fight	153.54
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as	332.89
now where are you going to brussels if you like it is the nearest	122.39
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same	739.10
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this	312.59
then taking the glass with firm hand she said	434.10
planchet repeated aramis and	110.73
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is	203.84
there was doubtful expression in noirtier eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing	194.18
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting	1173.82
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting do for instance fare better well wait patiently do not yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the	581.34
artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	85.32
all at once his ear caught sound resembling that of stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself	418.88
at the same instant his ear caught sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness	728.60
are you sure of it he showed it me but that is not all there is codicil as said just	109.38
maximilian who was paying them visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of	438.94
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	442.88
providence has declared for us since have found this brave man again in so miraculous	300.06
should dread some disagreeable encounter if were to go	1257.56
so thought the gascon here young blade who has already his love affair who doesn at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair	598.79
once more replied the	116.20
aramis stooped to kiss the king hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his	174.78
the beginning or the end the evening of the	252.07
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily	667.74
ah absurd they don burn sorcerers	20250.43
might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but did nothing of the sort suffered him and his band to	390.46
de chavigny who according to report was son of richelieu and had been creature of the late cardinal understood	460.73
milady had then made breach by her false virtue in the opinion of man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of man hitherto chaste and	321.19
at châlons was put upon the saône thence passed on to the rhône whence descended merely with the current to arles at arles was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to	759.83
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to	301.50
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much	59.73
unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one hope pronounced no name for knew none except his mother as young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her	294.21
sheathe then if you please and follow	71.34
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	279.29
artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe	182.36
how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dantès whole attention was riveted on man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of	623.20
five minutes had sufficed to make complete transformation in his	318.40
wretch cried artagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me woman whom don know but who is called	256.57
andrea read in low voice you are poor miserable old age awaits	415.70
artagnan who though wanting in practice had sound theory redoubled his	3062.53
so that now inquired the	81.32
they are destined to produce at least	243.26
of course that is perfectly just	257.34
that will keep us from going away from the east whither am tempted to think have been conveyed by some good	318.33
the past the count departed with sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her	200.86
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was painted	591.14
in that case said bazin he must be pretty	199.60
she was talking with great animation with the	243.22
and why asked scarron is he not man of good birth	372.55
that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to	76.15
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived considerable body of horsemen about half league	689.11
but my dear count	42.82
bah said artagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride the carriage and exterminate those who may be in	167.86
de morcerf will kill	64.03
which is the young man asked de winter turning	32.85
to which of us asked all the four	164.84
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des	434.14
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly	439.37
whether am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way	188.94
he then made sign for mousqueton to come to	61.74
what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we	95.09
want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	135.15
it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten clock if he did not return by ten clock she was to	131.12
she was tall woman with slender figure and forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens	1097.76
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did	662.74
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by long	384.37
mousqueton said artagnan you must render me	83.11
the queen uttered piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by	137.51
here said the prince handing him purse here is for	413.55
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us invite you with good	281.22
which he had occupied on his last stay at	297.68
this time there could be no doubt artagnan was really	133.82
it is his way and you must take him as you find	47.29
they were his friends and not	175.39
what was it then it was an	109.41
let us see the watch said	61.29
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their	294.56
the king closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis	382.97
meantime artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	113.95
well laporte asked the	99.18
you know it don you no sing it	412.56
and by the rapid glance that the young man eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this	848.40
yes particularly if you follow the instructions am about to give	111.15
murmured he growing still	1988.25
what clock is it the baron drew out his	282.82
from my earliest recollections have been beloved by no one so much the worse that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of	217.52
retire valentine said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink glass of pure water it will restore	234.15
what dost thou there rascal asked	4401.31
ah diavolo he exclaimed forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of	259.41
you have deceived me said the cardinal	72.50
the vendomois road he	2490.17
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural	410.11
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its	416.17
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes am really	303.43
had been warned by the authorities that celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or	577.05
having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his	234.38
he then concluded it must be an	257.07
the same said	181.51
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on certain	161.94
andrea had	828.50
thought as much said artagnan wasting his strength in useless	521.46
now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with	36.79
you came from country where he must be very much talked of and know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the	213.76
monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his	525.95
let me see your plan dare say it is pretty	189.12
five minutes the door keeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and said beauchamp shared the general expectation and	270.98
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring and at the caprice of the	279.35
do not send you away but you have had the small pox and am afraid that sitting up late may tire	391.61
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were	234.84
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her	97.94
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and	306.66
what did you say sir asked the	26.44
table ready set out awaited	1014.31
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means	355.06
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is dead nation he wished to find method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though place great confidence in busoni am not responsible for	424.39
it would be fatal to his	135.24
then he will be able to give us an answer	82.64
to horse said lord	808.04
come reflect and	3398.16
our family although still rich for my father income amounts to half million has experienced many misfortunes and myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years have not seen the author of my	269.88
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour	499.31
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to	61.90
milady secret artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this	220.27
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and should have news from those without the prison	238.12
yet replied beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity	2998.65
for one second artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping portion of his face was uncovered and artagnan recognized the	136.09
there do you see madame he recognizes you and	289.77
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor	127.08
but once again that gentleman where is he what has become of him is he dead is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to	238.25
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as	242.00
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring	440.43
the young man was overwhelmed as he	74.56
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond	415.98
but you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged you are the master and could not have the least word to	115.18
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his	196.00
are we threatened with fresh reign of terror asked	894.42
peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless explain myself in	531.30
the other was large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal	384.32
ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck door your fortune is	211.84
we shall wait for you artagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear	76.85
at noon they rode into the avenue of	497.93
take care you assert great deal said	599.00
well he told me that benedetto who is considered serpent of subtlety and giant of cunning is really but very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs his	640.74
yes they sent me the order of charles	334.94
old dantès was dead and mercédès had	101.79
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your	419.35
is it not so eh who knows never mind said milady writing the name on half sheet of paper will compromise	481.50
what end would that answer to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were	526.15

nothing bad has happened to him then absolutely	423.98

he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and	350.59

first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three clock in the morning when deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till	273.71

when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on artagnan but more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his	269.87
but how inquired am to maintain myself and my poor sister person whose confessor am replied he and who entertains high regard for me applied to me short time since to procure him confidential	538.38
mercédès said the count do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed	179.39
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at	130.83
de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than foreign princess who was enormously fond of	416.43

without further explanation artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu	153.32
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards	176.76
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress	580.07
because he plainly perceives that his piquette stands in need of being enlivened by mixture of good	791.65

on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest	77.45
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the	290.31

in the midst of this avenue was nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on tall	394.50
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for gentleman that of the	87.10
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous	1010.14
was the gascon determined to keep it as weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as last resource for his outfit it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of	265.58
artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat single	142.63
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not	268.61
well sir returned mazarin prudence is fine thing but to day you might regret having been too	507.97

let us speak	28.93
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like	355.92

this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his	264.60
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with malady of the skin which worries him to death and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in very short time the usurper will be	231.25

yes keep it keep	773.00
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the	252.46

it is even probable that shall have to make	193.33
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is	430.82
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which have made of man of marseilles whom have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my	157.68

now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of man perfectly well satisfied with	294.80
the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant	575.95
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron right hand with his left and held out his other	445.69
it was artagnan who now shook his head in his	47.48
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of million to	604.95
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winter inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without	336.99
count have reflected on the matter said franz thank you for your courtesy but shall content myself with accepting place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del	170.84
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio	103.47

said albert the engagement is broken	352.99
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in person of his years and light and steady on his feet as cat or lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command perfect view from top to	250.34

the heart of the young man overflowed with	115.61

now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place	205.43
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by too extravagant	518.08
ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	864.09
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her	688.95
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary	114.39
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to	85.01
but would you believe it he was not	127.56
dantès noticed that the captain of jeune amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw four ounce ball thousand paces or	1058.64
the old man declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless	228.03
andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the	90.31
for while nothing was heard in the room but succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to	455.27
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his	199.21
nevertheless you come as one in	300.38
shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo wait for	73.91
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was	123.33
yes have said it and now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent	1353.87
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by single	455.16
have enemies replied dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for	289.83
not scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his	167.37
will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his	102.03
athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his	159.71
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such	155.46
and you will pay ready	510.19
so artagnan resumed you will not become partisan of mazarin nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor	386.53
with heavy heart artagnan again bent his way toward the	426.44
briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day tomorrow at two clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great	214.03

from that time looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for particular	259.57
it is well returned the voice	244.47
bring hither that	1331.08
don know what you mean nor do even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous creature the more so as you tell me this artagnan is libertine duelist and	171.47
de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable	1367.34
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the	127.33
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of silk dress turned	488.95
so that thanks to her friend generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near	600.66
turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on	193.34
madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her	157.53
and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest	167.20
will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no know my place and am not so	138.86
lieutenant yesterday said aramis captain to day colonel doubtless to morrow in fortnight the fellow will be marshal of	457.79

empty he exclaimed the infernal demons we must pursue them said groslow they can be gone far and we will sink them passing over	290.97
sure enough upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in	243.96
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on	257.20
you will be brave and adventurous	364.65
and where did you get so much money said	68.37
say that she is hostage for the parisians answered the	111.92
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing	337.54
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father or in his cabin on board	106.13
yes keen and cutting	7057.26

the prince read as he hastened	272.05
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the	246.62
you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen	78.91
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in few moments opened his	126.10

the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and	534.12
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and artagnan and advanced toward the	94.01
the catalans	1988.27
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all	176.19
the authorities were not in condition to cope with serious	635.96
athos and he exchanged some words in low voice then the tall man made sign to the musketeer that he might come	81.00
with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to artagnan who has steady hand and will go and play in the first gaming house we come	125.06
but excellency said pastrini still striving to gain his	814.13
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for	214.78
by the bye continued artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his	266.33
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the	310.17
the man who had followed danglars sat down on	201.00
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of	284.90
could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and	21069.74

but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you man and woman oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never never could not to me to brother said	268.25
ah haitians that is quite another thing haitians are the of french stock	1366.56

but which must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission have just received from her	161.80
think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this	498.23
olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master	634.64
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it	1656.50
yes no	73.22
artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from false position like that of man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in conversation that does not concern	183.86
well then did he ask you who	75.18
give the lackeys money and they will	288.70
well said renée cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own physician for	441.45
de tréville spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in	436.74
villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian the first was royalist the other suspected of	273.92
he had to contend against strong wrist but his agility was superior to all	839.39
so shall never be great man as he was but to compensate for that shall be good man monsieur de rochefort and hope to prove it to	102.44
certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past	300.30
morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury well why paid	359.36
artagnan then related the poisoning of	263.79

that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is man of undoubted	738.96
dream of vengeance chapter	1840.08
his first cry was for his father but that father was	117.49
well what then well the englishman and his companion are still	159.28
simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably	436.68
know you are accustomed to assassinate people but warn you shall defend myself even against	223.80
an ironical smile passed over albert	1334.20
it was night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his	504.46
give it to me	21.49
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for	172.91
where is he gone the half pistole is for me doubtless answer	418.92
we will take bite and shall be there as soon as you	66.01
the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the	379.71
your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my	215.02
and by whom is this order given asked the	231.30
poor devil and he is dead yes sir five or six months ago last	328.28
let us do justice to	163.24
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was	189.67
but on my soul it looks	329.08
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled	186.61
these considerations naturally gave villefort feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its	1215.00
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said felton with increasing	357.72
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are	127.68
we shall be murdered there said	85.24
for the assassination itself had never felt any	642.26
consoled for what for my	142.99
and the greek princess will she be here no you will be deprived of that pleasure her position in the count establishment is not sufficiently	271.12
we were beginning to grow impatient said	193.95
we shall not interfere with each other your object is title mine	357.47
he soon perceived that slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now	314.11
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt pain in the left arm similar to that of blow from	283.02
at the first words of this address artagnan had seized porthos arm which he pressed with gradually increasing	391.00
do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as shared yours at rome who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist excellence_ for except myself these rooms would not hold shadow more unless that shadow were	793.51
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going	251.19

they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest	305.80
am your	1049.50
don know what devil of an insect stung me and made me	552.67
that true said artagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in that	123.11
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an	110.82
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the	452.78
it was that of number of men steadily	337.61
you have had proof of that in what you have just related to	63.26
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the	189.63
this manœuvre was to	310.56
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was	293.84
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken	253.19
her first movement was	2236.35
he again cried porthos who was breathing like blacksmith bellows why he is made of	584.75
oh my god what has he done poor dear man he is innocence itself and something like faint smile lighted the still terrified features of the young	306.02

you are the only man of whom have heard her speak with	127.59
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust	417.47
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	550.50
will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my	375.09
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid all were it my	190.30
grimaud agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible	339.71
what you say is perhaps true they know my	251.32
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the	82.52
come continued artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my	127.82
call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the	121.05
artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for do not forget that owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your	203.00
does he wear them no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his	298.82
it was as we have said the st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in	112.35
and of what are you so sure would say that know this great	131.03
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy such was cardinal richelieu opinion my	317.34

permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when purchased	176.57
the two friends turned down the first street they came	54.42

put back that weapon artagnan said he this woman must be tried not	281.08
well monsieur let us go to	34.11

monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous	244.94
marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on one wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry	624.48
staked on	145.96
you do not madame at least hope	90.31

the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected	196.57
in the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect that is to say those who were	587.73
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them precaution which made their situation	290.47
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking	203.52

well morrel let us both examine the depths of your	157.75
on seeing me die such death the most inexorable will have pity on	411.22
and can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget	213.24
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil	74.71
and is not above fifteen feet from it about	294.79
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him	190.71

do not think so added château renaud with the air of man who knows the whole of the european nobility	105.06
now said aramis tell me little what you do	94.02
but he added in despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and shall die without	161.01
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to	251.68

he heard hasty steps the creaking of door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards turnkey entered saying here is the brazier	946.89
having sought for few minutes he stopped at leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his auteuil rue de la fontaine	305.81
and grimaud threw the dagger on the	127.85

two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was	242.54
this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen am at your	180.59
but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said	277.82
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so	144.79
was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting captain themselves feel convinced their choice would have fallen on	582.09
do sometimes soldier though	2274.69

the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five clock in the morning until nine clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be second	217.81

then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had	221.12
it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with haggard	48.39
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post horses at	741.64

in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into small compass had the form of cylinder and was not easily kept	248.13
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that	325.81
that renders it useless to get pleurisy by too much	945.52
let us go to the	16.35

each of them when the other was not looking hazarded sly	438.63
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered	310.19
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel acknowledge that if albert is brave he cannot be coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than	226.05
explain yourself mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive	570.46
de villefort nor valentine could consistently	2319.82
then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on	219.46
very well	255.02
this one is think sterlet said château	392.39
come you shall take charge of the money of the jewel box so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers	204.63

she turned towards him with serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to	68.38
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying	837.93
but said renée this letter which all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king	271.63

the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make step	220.90

of glorious memory who was the king of the gascons as his majesty philip	415.11
always ready	1956.36
if you had only to deal with four men artagnan would allow you to go	89.08
rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of	476.73
the story interests you does it not sir inquired	526.16
if it is snare replied artagnan shall scent it out be	356.31
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added	1376.74
well then he is bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere	659.31
you think then said he that am taken to the château if to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so	121.72
wherefore sir excuse curiosity but wish to be enlightened on the	268.93
will tell you the real	280.40
the deliberations had already	602.76
tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in	245.88
he fell down this morning and broke his	153.50
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had artagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her	197.64
see they are	63.23
ah monsieur you may take my word when tell you	76.95
from the top of an eminence artagnan perceived group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint	174.25
think often of	1084.00
yes count and charged with commission for which beg of you to accept my	240.00
yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal few threads to	467.95
grimaud was about to reply to excuse	58.32
yes your eminence it is the	37.43
what do you intend doing valentine held down her head she was	227.10
groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and	1341.02
all yes	540.15
the remembrance of strafford was source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and	597.43
she was most atrocious	891.03
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his	420.71
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine	232.29
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as	353.59
the baroness porthos will sound particularly	2813.82

the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish	959.74
he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his	1226.49
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately raoul	198.80
what proposition thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had deficiency to make up indeed said the	530.12
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest	285.37
go to your chamber said she to	85.18
at the noise raised myself up on one	188.48
de villefort was the first to give the signal of	61.26
he was the son of banker at lyons named particelli who becoming bankrupt chose to change his name to emery and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with strong recommendation to louis	871.39
red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic	379.05
begin with his father if you	59.38
indeed said artagnan am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine	186.11
be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only question of how much shall be charged for	190.79
saw then that we were descending large staircase around us were all my mother servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest	887.55
elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick	3496.71
then admit my patience failed me drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge fancied felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his	246.38
gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into banner and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and	375.67
but your mother asked the	57.32
do you think the poison he fell victim to was intended for him	215.05
very well you are always the same athos great and	296.01
there are twenty five bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my	215.04
artagnan began to	134.64
now then do you wish for anything else said the	71.42
false why should that man give me false diamond to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead caderousse remained for moment aghast under the weight of such an	377.74
artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same	183.05
will not sign this order and why not because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the	141.64
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the of the bride elect was on	293.66
bertuccio said	15.27
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up needle on the floor of closed	155.72
so much the	144.80
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off	318.12
and its aim is	6936.01
yes said albert	172.60
in france he cried the usurper in france then they did not watch over this	112.62
the baroness then thought	173.68
let your majesty	792.93
faith said madame de chevreuse say	53.31
well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if kill you shall have the air of boy	263.81
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for	216.88
our best born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain	738.51
glad he cried should be more than glad happy beyond measure well am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good	195.87
excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap am not up there know but have only just come	111.70
but as cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the	313.97
bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about	303.01
this is all very strange	92.79
bertuccio bowed and left the	69.60
here is monsieur comminges said artagnan returning to the	68.61
whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown	469.03
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart can find no	722.63
be content will	4651.16
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in	254.26
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where hear his highness the prince of wales now	204.49
hope to be captain without that said	116.44
only await one thing before following your advice that is minister who will hold office for six	326.17
the spahis are french cavalry reserved for service in	4340.57
know you even better	401.32
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he	134.80
as am of the church and the affair might injure me if should share it with any other than sure friend like you write to beg that you will serve me as	200.19
with single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as	266.53
the door was wide open hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard strange sight before so noble mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his	268.29
alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear	168.27
of course cried	338.48
artagnan replied in such manner that kitty remained in her great	313.05
well then to my health although am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to	104.52
wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment felt blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell	151.70
hope sir replied the youth smiling that there no idea of marriage for me you know of my engagement to louise athos in his turn smiled	163.43
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	403.57
here was the officer artagnan was	158.36
the name of your ship inquired	171.22
the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations	219.16
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of	147.45
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès the manner of labor saving pioneer dug mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made match by rolling his handkerchief in	819.65
are you not rather	106.75
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived	178.65
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to	83.26
yes said athos by his own	76.70
but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his	295.06
yes monseigneur said	45.65
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving artagnan composure that as have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your	147.44
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also	1787.77
his house has he built one here then no but he has very comfortable one all the same so they	343.12
well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying	265.59
know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept	130.84
he kept his word twice day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with	598.94
in one hour the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with	920.96
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to	364.20
bonacieux the one he had just picked	124.34
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	1116.49
years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of artagnan at	379.36
what shall say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst artagnan and porthos stepped	167.19
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of	652.53
scarcely had artagnan uttered these words when ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the	245.07
morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such lively sensation and to beseech him to make	249.58
the young man was opening the door of the	39.30
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his	120.64
in july we added francs it was you know the month of the spanish	299.17
the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and presented as warlike an	378.19
artagnan came again on the morrow and the day that and each day milady gave him more gracious	206.22
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the	236.44
how it is sometimes essential to government to cause man disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their	1225.73
and now the ranks began to	212.81
in the place of the palais royal artagnan saw sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred	210.22
oh beautiful life yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy days my love my blood my life all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing look at the gold which sparkled on the	371.04
it was then part he was playing yes my	235.39
the latter made sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf are you not no replied madame danglars am too	95.06
will appeal to any of these gentlemen could leave my guest in the hands of hideous bandit as you term him besides you know had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when came to	268.51
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally	444.19
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on impartial_ the paper of which beauchamp was the chief	257.51
he is also the bearer of second confidential epistle for his	324.93
soho cried	76.35
well said the young woman what you dreaded has	97.85
he then	443.45
de villefort in condemning culprit to death	736.57
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by forced smile that you have already got horses	204.04
am sure he will look like the great mogul they made halt for an hour to refresh their	306.82
willingly answered the duke give me the pie am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to	127.95
as the door closed them kitty rushed toward	272.52
why she inquired in hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to	212.37
he is at	589.08
was told there were such at the last	433.36
advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	91.89
there and	2939.33
martin with his garrison and threw hundred men into little fort called the fort of la	724.72
artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens past danger particularly when the danger seems to have	499.34
this personage	288.88
bertuccio said the count am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like man possessed by devil who will not leave him and have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is	206.41
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with gentleman and they treated him like very	203.28
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the	1304.07
then he had eaten some without saying word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the	527.58
then fearful crash was heard cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said	269.50
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made sign that artagnan and porthos should give	161.58
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for moment he had hoped to carry it	242.70
that pretty little whom artagnan had already observed then came	309.64
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can do for you mordaunt reflected moment and some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this	261.85
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	165.44
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the	399.98
foi_ yes like you hesitated but the count eloquence decides	702.81
feel the same as regards	573.06
artagnan turned to	77.99
marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound	120.09
well for the king service we need	314.86
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by	252.10
why do you doubt the past that obscurity on the	150.79
why it seems to me replied morrel that in	100.47
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted kiss on it but she herself felt that it was kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of	155.19
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself	162.54
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that	470.58
we are first said morrel looking out of the	56.94
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini account of vampa having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing	284.40
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them	129.88
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	234.30
really then that person is most amiable	510.54
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not know	71.21
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are	455.75
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden	367.85
and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his	497.35
but there are four against you leave off command	387.54
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his	936.84
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that shall probably be skinned never mind ll fix that all	487.22
porthos was in bed and was playing game at with mousqueton to keep his hand in while spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the	784.41
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length valentine	374.58
the two gentlemen then went into the	73.91
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were fool not to have pretended to accept the	141.97
the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in low tone to de winter if you need money my lord separate the jewels have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some	238.18
artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering fervent prayer to	367.83
what milady has he not come said	224.08
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and	222.08

artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen party in the	167.98
artagnan looked at the two women one the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made mistake in their	209.75

he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers	1031.67
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with blind valor quick eye and prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether besme maurevers poltiot de méré or	769.02

he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the	102.92
perhaps what am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but never seek to protect society which does not protect me and which will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them low place in my esteem and preserving neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to	322.91
too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal	258.14

that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live single	548.92
well then listen valentine said the count have favor to ask of	97.30
the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la	154.33
but excessive grief is like storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the	595.49
ah my lord if mistake not the chevalier artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for fear that this man is entirely devoted to the	165.26

de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest	353.11
the cardinal there awaited louis	2577.95

he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the	227.76
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other	152.16
what should care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and felt certain that no one could deprive me of her but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage do not think that is the	203.87

once outside the city artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering little	475.98
ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into passion at random at noisy take care for warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long rip him	421.60

franz paused for	222.66
artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity came to paris with exactly such	427.06
you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but should not have recollected it if you had not reminded	93.18
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said artagnan directing the sick man attention to the full stewpans and the empty	365.27
however to teresa great astonishment luigi remained mute and not word escaped his lips the rest of the	403.36
faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me	668.75
ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could	65.56
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert mask fell	1927.44
of what importance is this little reptile to you asked	244.80
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only political	124.52
de villefort house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our	458.16
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the	184.33
come my lord you shall be treated like prince as you	80.88
aramis and his thesis artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator	170.35
he called out to the postilions at every	330.61
artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us	349.22
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from wish like submissive and devoted daughter slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice	930.72
bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground	399.39
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of	83.72
but why should it do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and much fear she envies me the fortune enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death	310.53
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of marble	775.36
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort faithful servant of the king does not know	117.31
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and	144.72
it was pledge	2473.81
will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with serene and glowing	806.01
then with friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like serpent through the opening and	530.58
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible that ever	218.50
why should you not be there because you have not yet invited	67.13
they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was	541.50
my safety is now mere question of	1212.98
for what reason the same as	315.26
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people can they have received any news my lord not from england	300.10
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for	132.62
again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more	198.34
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice week the prisoners were deprived of	943.18
and now my lord that see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal	79.91

and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to	100.49
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers	105.73

but what can be the matter your note of this morning has completely bewildered	233.07
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de	265.80
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in	641.70
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly	282.00

it was subsequently to these dreadful events that waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was	238.34
they sat silent and	1710.18
let us return to my ring or rather to	96.04

inspector continued the governor can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five	80.13
directly afterwards the moon	748.32
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his	290.33
how do you mean said valentine looking anxiously	169.89
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which was sleeping and on opening my eyes saw hers filled with	254.93
well my friend bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you	207.46
you say	157.34
the count took out small quantity of this with gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing long steadfast glance upon	502.27
artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized	277.35

the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	124.94

the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès she pressed her son hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved	302.43

the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than	147.22
but they believe am shut up alone	445.72
what are we to say to this asked	67.29

sir said the servant have favour to ask	106.00
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had	1215.66
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the	242.56
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please want capital to build my plans	459.80

meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely short carbine and pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with single barrelled	774.07

morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although was certain he was at home he would not make any	95.04
albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at moment when his honor was so powerfully	374.82
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love	205.01

during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he	301.20

andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by sound sleep and good	380.16

it happened that on this particular night the minister box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in	176.05

the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet	95.64
now if you please remove your	345.73
yes count replied villefort in voice now scarcely	298.42
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of	539.73

an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to	489.30

only grazed little replied artagnan my fingers were caught between two stones that of the wall and that of my ring and the skin was	300.56
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship hastened to	374.02
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and	104.73
but what help is there for it captain is nothing but father of family charged with even greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary	366.77
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all artagnan	411.78

at the hint from the mendicant his master made him sign to retire and he was obliged to	101.36
prize it it was given to my ancestor by king	293.27
but artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse	393.00
two hours passed	659.09
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my	169.77

the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the	506.17
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given	243.70

the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his	115.45
porthos bowed as if in	353.37

comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second	236.15

raoul gives me much uneasiness he	263.67
bazin my friend come	110.07
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the	142.90
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the	199.54
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and wave passed over his head which drowned his	269.44
artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	512.35
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too	396.25

which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could	124.26
the prisoner first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of	485.06

monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than visit to the room they were about to	80.39
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered	2253.40
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the	128.62

athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read	210.15
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with artagnan when he was on	159.55
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that	134.85

he gave porthos second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the	163.72
haydée scarcely had the count horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and	295.32

sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for	335.97
without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is	227.95
the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his	295.71

did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before	127.60
ah now think of it the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the hall said	84.98
all this doubt only gave rise to more lively desire of arriving at certainty and he went into his friend chamber with fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of	304.09
athos who heard milady voice came sharply	911.97
he answered in the same	124.86
for heaven sake where is that asked the	330.64

dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading	307.06

franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do	268.80

at this moment sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was	134.83
amen exclaimed artagnan stopping the	354.98
you know he is almost	312.90
of that which am ready to feel toward	159.17
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his	473.42
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his	96.24
then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as	224.31

he had entered villefort office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his	130.52

yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four	149.82
why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached	381.46
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of	326.98

oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches thou who like beings of superior order to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth if death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered then noble heart sublime soul then conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped his hands	688.81

will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with noble	155.15
then artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows artagnan was not millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far	214.91
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous	944.25

our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his	206.34
and sire	113.60
quiet was at length	262.29
he stood watch day and night with lance provided with lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my	634.46
my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to	123.74
nothing nothing go on your advice then to take the hundred pistoles	145.93
ah ah but what going on in the city yonder said	198.64
artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her	277.75
unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must	156.97
but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase	381.79
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain	157.03
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we	255.83
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find	352.87
these arrangements made the lackeys	919.18

yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said	71.17
let us decamp first and you will understand	383.25
franz and the countess exchanged smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and	201.89
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the	179.15
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend said	41.73
of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less	162.35
or dreamed he was and awoke	910.67

several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from	212.98
well said	8.74
cavalcanti looked at danglars with stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young	209.43
violent convulsion attacked the old	401.91
it was worth while truly added the young man with melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody	158.46

madame replied athos have only to ask your majesty	119.27
still that idea of death madame said	110.07
why asked monte	31.27
amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing	341.89
but said the count so great was ali pasha confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my	335.73

short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk	332.29
let us sit	115.18
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for made them by serving your	437.78

listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy	226.95
ah said morrel one quits dungeon in week month or	1490.33
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against	216.01
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not	87.91

you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing	488.82
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no	111.03
artagnan was woman and still more	271.64

athos made two visits in paris at seven clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and	255.87
de saint méran whose sole heiress	818.39
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and	233.09
few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with	219.54
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported	350.81

the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell third	260.35
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the	219.52
artagnan thought of all these	254.36

baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at	87.88
but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an	73.92
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling	103.78

bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him look of inscrutable	173.90
and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained	236.48
the man whom he had seen seated on fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing	178.39

an instant bazin made his appearance at the	71.72
eh rascal said artagnan do you not recognize his highness the prince carriage prince or not said the man	239.61
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble	207.61

two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came	409.36
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of friend and on the other the foot of	352.40
no doubt said milady coolly such woman may be	183.16
mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is hand to guide	508.45

about eleven clock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed	103.71
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and	143.60
the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since saw you madame bonacieux and should not be astonished if in the course of few months it were to excite the envy of many	230.46
yes since you have such good	173.96
artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la	159.59
what is it but remember ah mute as	784.11
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my	413.04

albert was used to the count manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the	121.35

twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting	2675.73
now should any letters or other documents of compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted	931.49
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your	149.42
let the man go artagnan let us save the	138.87
they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue	145.45
artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past	167.81
what of danglars yes to be sure must say baron danglars might as well say count	508.52
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of	1997.93
or camille de bois	23601.74
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly	278.19
unless copyright notice is	5041.25
doubt it planchet replied artagnan but what are you thinking of am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we	216.11

at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of	272.04

de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for	385.09

during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by solemn	515.67
now then let us	88.31
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent	222.73
ah pardon me said château renaud have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and cannot understand them	129.14
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen	118.77

we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for	279.97
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either	545.10
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet	113.82

aramis look at that horse oh the frightful brute said	485.64
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to	196.08

ah said the count in somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural	266.52
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by	369.35

there was moment silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the	319.05

these were the first words he had	100.66
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first	100.15

the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the	649.33

return emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you morrel accompany me to the champs	217.11

secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of	171.42

ah that would be great pity said	80.25
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen	179.91
the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other	313.61

danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke	354.56

porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large	154.58
well then you shall see it	48.50
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of gendarme appear at one of these	336.10

this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this	310.55
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the	219.54
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find certain difficulty in circumventing	526.54
then artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of nature to reassure the most	422.71
held back his	152.28
will you examine	235.37
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at little boat made fast to pile and ready rigged as if waiting to	468.68
these poor creatures had no bad	1210.28
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against	251.46

you must know felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in pink satin jacket and cap that could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style actually clapped my hands with	563.98
and asked mazarin moment	890.34

at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to	387.79
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal	261.44
but know you my lad said athos appearing on the	173.60
no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you yes do remember replied the	79.44
ah said the marquise de saint méran woman with stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the	559.81
at that moment the door	35.54
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back	313.74

as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than	308.09
morrel attributed penelon embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the	291.93

one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at cabaret on the high road man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink glass of wine and darted searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were	191.39

smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the	100.14
yes if am killed said albert	108.01
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like thunderbolt and she fell	197.70
henry said charles call me your	189.82

come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not	73.58
god grant you as much let us	165.40

notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers artagnan felt completely	479.46
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking	202.85
yes replied morcerf he said something about it to	79.89
well why should not we too belong to party you had your secret and we had ours we didn exchange	437.47
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two	107.95

the pope awaited	1438.47
the cardinal was speaking to him in low voice and the king was very	39.16
then let us draw on the	71.74
épinay for he came this morning to	139.36
ah yes about year the disappearance of his son the poor old man	256.13
franz felt shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal	236.43
you are here said	25.94
how gardener may get rid of the dormice	926.87
franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with	131.31
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church	204.89
in corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from	1002.32
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years	245.01
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who	115.23
good lord how cold am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to house set out with all the attributes of suburban tavern and knocked at the	154.77
in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascon hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave terrible trace in it and athos bowed to artagnan like man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his	158.08
yes but in my soul much more than in my	133.54
with such mecum_ artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his	697.82
permit me madame said artagnan to reserve portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done	247.66
while yet young unfortunately handsome was dragged into	2990.59
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in	309.12
we must then as it appears to me travel in	148.51

artagnan friends reminded him that he had visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to	133.18

the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived large white	254.64
persons whom do not like yes	209.66
jesus dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is knight of malta as timid as young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket	396.15
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the	149.86
they then set off for	255.51
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	330.33
it was the portrait of young woman of five or six and twenty with dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long	400.88
ah cried albert it is very lucky	75.88

this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter	570.17
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but cannot suffer poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your	295.68
the baroness was	239.96

the minister bowed his head and while deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph	470.16
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying knew it guessed it but too late by minute unfortunate unfortunate that am felton made no	209.26

my wife escaped cried	774.21
why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any	217.35
artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen	200.73
now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and	320.13
noirtier and the elder épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his	498.88
there is here no question of crime or	262.96
monsieur said athos placing his hand on artagnan shoulder monsieur is the chevalier artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak	144.99
no no answered dantès don imagine am going to put you off in that shabby	259.89
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the	159.56
porthos maintained majestic	21879.50

vampa took cucumetto body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained	258.67

with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever	263.88
please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of procurator wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected	349.91
with two companions he	157.00
like all other things of this world having had beginning had an end and this end our four companions began to be somewhat	390.28
be satisfied said the procurator	126.32
the owner did not wait for second	338.14
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	225.98
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words man lying on coil of cables rose and advanced few steps toward	288.92
you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more	128.36
they reached saint german without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bare headed to offer her his	489.66

at last their hilarity calmed down and faith exclaimed artagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin for assure you on his side he wishes you no	327.92
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of jew dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs	410.77
you do	739.54
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated determined to obtain few hours	397.85
you are welcome count she exclaimed as he	245.66
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet	386.35
agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all	322.30
the tunic soon disappeared under long cassock as did his hair under priest wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an	1497.50

calm yourself dear rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen	344.46
it was your granddaughter then was it not	163.80
well said he do you still doubt oh murmured the young	54.03
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted	341.90
has he not son young man relative nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said ward who is called the vicomte de	302.29
danglars thought it as well to comply with good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed	381.30
albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide she had finished reading this	232.74
good he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the	235.80
well no madame this is the terrible news have to tell you said villefort in hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred	235.10

however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former	333.41
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die	553.40
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and	321.18
well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the	152.98
but what is the meaning of this change cannot tell	60.36
one of the notaries sat down the other remained	222.47

danglars thought la testa_ meant put in your head he was making rapid progress in	828.49
in this state of mutual understanding they reached	768.52

but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this	250.99
next moment artagnan	147.65
strange athos was scarcely aged at all his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than	813.46

planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while artagnan turned the two horses into lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind hedge of	283.52

instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent	265.54
as further precaution they had bound his	441.11

no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois and make hole in the cask with	291.71
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in ceremonial	121.46
from you	79.13

minute the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo	128.75
this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was	158.41
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to	176.47
bad joke of the husband substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and have obtained full	416.43
you told him that said porthos broad smile spreading over his honest	439.62
true forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he	246.86
he walked straight up to him and placed pistol to his	135.01
valentine rushed towards him his lips again	199.46
morrel good worthy man said	180.72
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was	114.78
was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the	255.83
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont	698.10
what could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that	193.71
what wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what wrist silence god gives me strength to overcome wild beast like you in the name of that god act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving	549.09
albert was on the point of pronouncing his father name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was	149.05
yes returned dantès holding out his hand thank you	200.34
but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see	184.19
now my fault is	615.50
and that he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated	874.53
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through	214.93
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès	178.86
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to	75.92
lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon couch on the other side of the	182.72
the clock struck half past six and lady was announced friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with	166.80
how curious what is his name the abbé	271.05
the devil but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that am convinced that there is less love than politics in all	90.00
true dantès forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely	493.80
wait little porthos before crying out for on my word you haven reached the end said the gascon in jesting	404.52
give me then that letter madame time	489.13
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with	691.23
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had	308.12
but monte cristo is not the only one miss here do not see	134.40
the eyes of the paralytic expressed multitude of tumultuous	1010.36
yet must know his	137.20
he must be indeed strange	217.81
then he turned to the	43.77
the hostess who knew artagnan skill with the sword began to weep and tear her	326.53
the religion serve the god adore were blasphemed because called upon that religion and that god but still	2018.42
ah always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself	674.74
what ails you baron he	799.54
so thousand questions which met with only word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged	1025.02
oh monseigneur revoir_ monsieur bonacieux revoir and the cardinal made him sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the	237.48
the child accepted	8926.65
he is going to turn his house into as the germans term	276.61
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the	318.68
pardon me for instance say to my friends be on certain day on certain hour at the other side of the moat with two	128.71
on the corner of mantelpiece in small room on the fifth	166.56
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been	82.50
danglars speculates whereas he never	3620.59
go to selim cried my	228.04
albert had you been stranger foreigner simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom killed to get rid of should not have taken this trouble but thought this mark of consideration due to	437.52
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot my dear boy what an idea where is the letter you speak of know you too well to suppose you would allow such thing to pass	275.04
the jailer came in the	93.70
oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad hoped for moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied	165.44
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to	226.88
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the	546.44
athos must have become an idiot by this time from	245.18
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed	502.23
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes	101.32
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own	85.02
it was then that he saw horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at little	131.56
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as	211.25
you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked indeed madame you believe me too credulous confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this	219.50
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored	837.48
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie	390.90
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to height of six	433.25
they then determined to	266.48
but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their	279.26
should never have the courage to come down	108.30
true on my honor as gentleman it shall be as thou dost	457.12
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him yes he placed the money in my hands at four and half per cent nearly five years	239.80
the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and must give it for	114.54
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was	176.36
she must have spoken she must have confessed everything woman is so weak dungeon the first he comes to that it night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations	205.18
they looked	98.20
if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers said tréville the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that demand an	208.83
it is all one to me now said artagnan am no longer	59.87
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of troop of	315.88
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket the casket would encumber	396.34
there said he it	176.48
de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such	191.41
may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket lecture and since it is my function to give them to others am rather averse to receiving them	194.77
but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is pardonable	1593.13
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with	2961.87
this village constructed in singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their	1084.44
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and	118.13
good at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that shall be ready to give you	204.36
good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow	505.69
cavalcanti remained master of the	290.70
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney piece they were pen ink and	282.54
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well	166.44
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with beating heart and brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty	301.16
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de	451.89
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the pope decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing joyous	805.68
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted	157.28
will not	193.31
the comte de la fère murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any	444.56
and have you never tried to understand them	148.05
asmodeus that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des prés while debray was casting up his	412.94
let us go to	43.32
must not be cast down by the discovery that have been	109.22
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that woman had come there alone about eleven clock the night before had engaged chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the	122.06
madame de villefort uttered wild cry and hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted	488.31
they both went into the house the drawing room was lighted up they went in	141.72
that is	206.66
never mind that returned the sailor know their	621.80
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy	465.53
when your turn comes shall have the honor to inform you of	99.67
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of	526.35
athos waved his hand raoul bowed and artagnan and planchet set	156.14
man in mask cried	385.30
posterity will find difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by	1019.62
this place if monsieur herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the	275.79
she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal	267.94
as for me feel anxious to preach sermon said	472.38
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at	404.51
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the	89.37
as to franz strange transformation had taken place in	349.21
it is mixture of excellent opium which fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the east that is between the tigris and the	365.24
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was	209.30
ah said artagnan is that the way you return to your apartment nine at night pardieu said aramis the rule of the convent is very	127.21
he replied however in tone of deep interest entreat	232.13
then they were both	316.83
will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from blois to send me few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt you can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that have passed with	365.64
athos recognized	1618.03
ah by heaven it is god himself who sent us	258.38
thanks monsieur said monte cristo shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already	104.29
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at crown day but he had reckoned without his	603.74
milady was not woman to misunderstand the meaning of this	191.01
well will have franz and château renaud they will be the very men for	137.63
villefort dropped his head and	193.47
have sir comprehended your instructions athos	1482.25
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but two or three hours he encountered an	249.98
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old	88.26
an old	7827.38
died poisoned you know by what	395.00
during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored	228.44
she descended and went through the	103.42
act then as you think proper there is still time to	186.81
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then can continue my work in	136.28
cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous	143.88
athos is near you said artagnan warn him as have warned	105.83
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the	414.26
four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said artagnan raising his	169.87
if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are	334.42
now belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as	771.95
have you proof of this had	147.32
ah see you are	172.75
oh replied valentine with convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for soldier who they say never knows	361.67
holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet what your business here you hussy artagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the	232.81
you are deceived monsieur know her very	170.68
are you sure saw it	314.49
pardon me said albert was not aware that he was	50.03
the jailer	14279.83
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me wish to speak with this	81.33
ah don touch me pray	757.39
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count room and in ten minutes all will be	117.15
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about	432.01
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his	114.25
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson	171.27
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	196.89
who brought it into this room then mademoiselle	210.19
and who have answered for him to the queen who have promised my poor mistress ah my god my god she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies ah monsieur bonacieux never did love you much but now it is worse than	172.34
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to	245.82
will not sleep where must	1387.67
avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like second corpse in that chamber of	397.55
noirtier eye remained	3067.38
poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made	89.75
certainly do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you journalist the husband of renown it is the talk of all	69.15
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader	772.55
whom heaven protect from evil came into france would offer him my house my own house but alas it would be but an unsafe	512.88
fortunately said artagnan all this will be only necessary till tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have hope only men to	227.13
well am convinced they are all charming	432.87
never caution my servants second time remember	740.28
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	109.11
we and his majesty will lead the	169.42
accordingly that same evening milady commenced her	821.94
these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the	265.95
the only thing that astonished artagnan was that his friends had never thought of	133.73
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with messenger whom he did not wish to see at	467.60
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of gascon barely failed to	413.34
yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that	322.85
that does not concern	66.43
cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of	193.83
monsieur has returned then of course naively replied the	627.96
then why do you apply to me that may be sure have the right	64.50
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and	264.84
but there are no more said	52.97
what you start for paris you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to	131.77
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the	183.12
it was long time before was able to make out what place was in or to take account of the details	153.67
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry union with any other would have caused him the same	128.35
milady uttered frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her	523.04
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive	195.39
they went to rueil cried	147.76
that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us	102.74
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de	196.48
father and son	646.87
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and	383.01
can trust in you oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul am ready to die for your majesty this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking	110.37
he wore	14679.45
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita	277.24
charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest	1056.58
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by	506.18
shrink before nothing but	1348.68
and now am frondeur not of broussel party nor of blancmesnil nor am with viole but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and elbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and low born	1501.46
neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the	674.15
well observed the englishman as if he were slow of	250.17
bartholomew in and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to	496.73
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter can my lord said	147.50
but you is there nothing that you want we came here with the intention of asking for something to	118.52
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on	295.84
eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator wife as bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister	351.43
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another	322.42
go make out my bill and notify my	721.94
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly	234.97
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me	213.24
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the	150.56
pardon monsieur pity in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his	105.19
these last words were uttered in so low tone that the stranger could not hear	136.54
am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable	242.51
sire it is something more opaque than the	224.84
and said athos am returning to	159.40
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed	110.13
while the rest slept then we went away short distance we severed our fetters with file the englishman had given us and swam	814.64
perhaps not replied danglars but hear that he is ambitious and that rather against	145.40
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos for madame may say was your victim when wounded dying was abandoned by the	316.50
the clock struck nine as the door opened and coachman	387.05
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and	419.54
impossible and executed in our	387.30
it was wrong monsieur porthos but will repair that wrong upon my word of	274.92
great god said	129.86
now four days had elapsed and valentine still	682.96
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy	111.55
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the	315.63
then an idea came to him which harmonized	596.51
conditions why not because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors	265.04
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards luckily found small opening which afforded me view of the apartment and what was passing	536.40
go my dear curate and may god assist you and you sir continued gondy turning to the curate of	153.75
count he said swear to you my soul is no longer my	44.10
this and some dried fruits and flask of monte pulciano was the bill of	927.26
well did there not happen an event which saved austria why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie precisely said the	301.27
the stables are on either side of the gate which you see	147.93
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de	426.88
they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by fiery	817.50
ah that is different the house you purchase is at	245.53
deeply engaged with sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for moment to join in the	297.63
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be	747.25
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy may go where	252.21
and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left my dear porthos you are really man of most superior understanding said artagnan with look as if he spoke against his	110.09
de morcerf he whom wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom announced your promised visit and may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in	286.01
no what say replied bonacieux is only that may know whether am delaying	257.19
around this kind of rolling tent pressed crowd of gentlemen and	1035.69
it will be useless for him to find you	48.67
de morcerf will accompany	101.30
don be afraid said	52.37
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like train of lighted gunpowder along the	240.58
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	140.37
about this time the nurse cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with cup in her	105.77
and also said	185.75
it is very fortunate said artagnan to	41.19
in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like	374.73
you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before	231.74
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the	440.00
yes was the reply in low	101.35
how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight duel with pistols all the instructions had given	250.36
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful	1370.18
monsieur returned villefort was then royalist because believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the	342.88
thanks danglars that will smooth over all	1549.71
franz astonished advanced	8375.70
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere	435.40
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at	118.57
seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon artagnan but he had too strong an	131.65
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator	222.35
his mother he	263.77
will suppose anything you	236.75
this that another	1225.29
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection never to	272.64
the queen made curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under	728.86
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went	338.96
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making step toward the	126.39
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond	1300.02

and as am connoisseur in such things having had few of my own once estimated it at thousand	550.00
am lost said artagnan to	62.75
the queen is likely to follow mazarin counsels and to have me	370.13
you see then morrel that he was more unhappy lover than	159.79
only imagine what happiness that would afford	509.60
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin	163.48
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked	84.74
dust am and to dust	959.38
mazarin thought for an	103.18
and morcerf with forced smile arose and making low bow	715.57
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its	456.51
he has simply mahogany secretaire in which the key is always	591.02
then it is settled yes but where have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his	394.79
the middle one	2833.61
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur artagnan there not man in france that esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so on his account add two hundred	190.32
do lose by that no you are on the contrary	285.64
as one confides letter to the hollow of tree to the wing of pigeon to the collar of	313.22

artagnan of the king guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight	261.63
then cried planchet joyously see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we	112.71
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and	415.05
at least artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least shall not be alone in my	138.20
then should like to have three sons should make the first nobleman like athos the second good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like	591.82
most lovely creature upon my soul was his	952.03
planchet slept in the antechamber upon coverlet taken from the bed of artagnan and which artagnan from that time made shift to do	250.85
and la ramee was found locked up in the prisoner room gag in his mouth and poniard near	220.63
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than	334.25
beauchamp it is quite	407.00
that true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his	185.81
will run for it sir and the guide went	157.18
but he went on with his peculiar smile am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for	172.77

well that is all that wanted and will be guided by counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte	89.71

by her husband who was nobleman of your acquaintance continued artagnan looking intently at	242.28
they are soldiers though resumed de	1053.20
in the course of his morning walk he collected two or three small branches from tree and found small piece of broken glass discovery that quite delighted	359.08
which is to say that the gascons made king of me myself seeing that am my father son is it not tréville well happily don say nay to	273.97
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like	266.63
charles bowed and	206.86
gave the custom house officers copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent man off with the pilot to whom gave	335.93
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the	195.22
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another	361.37
alone he was alone again again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth was not faria fate the better all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like phantom over the abbé dead	408.74
that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome kind of lizard with vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the	754.94
this child has caused me to recover what had	149.12
the spadas remained in doubtful ease mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two	474.99
perhaps you speak the truth	214.93
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to	65.87
here one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses asked artagnan jumping on one of	444.78
today is the	114.95
now said gondy there is communion between	283.61
ah monsieur said artagnan as if to sum up in word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our	201.80
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in	171.85
oh yes they will only listen to that charming	346.86
but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	117.46
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his	559.67
well what do you propose to do she said at length come	93.11
the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and	104.46
next day hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the	295.91
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis	231.70
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at	200.28
two angelic	34424.46
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his	498.27
look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his	310.71
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to	77.26
villefort continued he knows me and have pledged my word to	122.24
he first	6178.54
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their	191.68
arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone found this broken sword blade as was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded	245.74
you are mistaken viscount believe he has not franc in his	302.36
rex ponticus_ said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at	842.14
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man hope you have sword at home but at all events have two and if you like will throw with you for one of	153.88
good thought gondy she is going to	218.22
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into	587.97
it is misfortune and government owes nothing to his	420.38
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and which prevented him from so	142.38
that was the very evening when the abduction of	130.29
morrel said not	357.05
on your honor on my	70.41
minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the	451.79
de chevalier dessessart to admit artagnan as cadet in his company of	646.71
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it	375.47
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via	301.10
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on	173.28
he is man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and thick	330.66
things look black enough replied porthos understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible	606.63
the fact is look to my turn for keeping guard with	433.48
merri was	544.39
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only right but	131.60
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in	113.17
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of	767.83
at that moment aramis	60.09
do not do so reverend	161.40
said artagnan can she have charged you to tell me so oh no monsieur but out of the regard have for you have taken the resolution to tell you	98.78
artagnan turned to look at his	56.71
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time artagnan was better informed than she	190.70
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over	206.49
they are all the same	119.92
another horse said	115.43
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled	252.09
no but franz has for heaven sake not word of this before	552.76
we will see gentlemen we will	51.54
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady	272.77
have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming	416.10
give up broussel she cried fine counsel	2114.16
and what did you understand by what we said thousand	110.55
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in	323.69
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the	205.13
go away now	2678.93
but what ails you you are	272.49
bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by artagnan and	124.64
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave start of surprise behind her	166.32
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the	194.83
de villefort has so many important and urgent	777.78
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if he coward he will disgrace thee some	326.85
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with	220.54
the blow was sped by artagnan the rapier had pierced his	631.44
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me single instant so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your	149.85
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by	566.80
napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of	707.02
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency	143.52
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary pen and some paper and placed them all on table where there was	269.45
franz remained moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief	741.14
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do have both reflected and decided answered	301.08
this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the	192.21
are you ready asked	196.96
cannot tell you that replied the inspector can only promise to examine into your	157.28
you told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser waited month or rather suffered for month did hope man is poor wretched creature did	486.36
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then	266.45
this crisis past endeavored to catch your eye but could	370.32
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two	261.65
what do you mean by the pure parliament are there then two parliaments my friend artagnan interrupted as don understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the	237.56
but could you not compromise matters and give up portion of your fortune to her son how could make such proposition especially to woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my	345.93
feel myself drawn toward you who have never loved anyone but my benefactor who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	411.88
when one puts on mask it is not difficult to wear beard under	433.78
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed	135.57
speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head crown which he stole from under pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me thank you	235.03
bravo thought artagnan on this side think the cardinal will be well	179.55
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered few remaining	447.00
now this was sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with	175.59
have already had the honor of telling you was said	128.32
what is that give ball you know how much the queen loves	306.59
artagnan glanced at the dinner	266.55
my only fear is that he will be too strong for	76.78
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him veritable	113.88
can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for	164.06
thanks gentlemen thanks as you see my health is but	350.27
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our	885.09
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was	161.86
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for	164.35
from their dress covered with dust and from certain easy manner by means of which man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of few	455.73
at last cried	134.06
have you cords to bind him with and gag to stop his mouth we	408.34
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place	424.07
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the	150.99
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the morrel son of	539.38
like many old houses occupied by single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because red curtain was drawn before the	263.17
that true said	73.09
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to	292.01
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal death as deliverance and even opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his	246.11
besides to tell truth whilst artagnan was quite disposed to adopt subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open	615.88
lions of roman crowns and which	307.93
here am milady here am cried kitty springing forward to meet her	400.91
the two witnesses	546.11
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the	611.24
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la	703.02
at this moment villefort returned followed by the lady maid and her came madame de	109.71
think he is about to leave paris he was going to his	54.27
what do you think of that exploit my lord it is magnificent said mazarin	111.39
yes monseigneur but told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue you are stupid replied the	196.44
debray she	63.95
it was very near thing but he is not	96.34
it was three clock at quarter past merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was clear profit of	531.63
those invincible men were subject to mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with	506.88
therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her	651.72
the innkeeper	26130.10
he turned to closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the	170.82

seizing pen he drew paper from secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his	253.84
ah ah you incline me to think so said the	153.28
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything	768.90
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my	108.03
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the	181.77

let my lord at two clock ask leave to make up game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the	253.92
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as was quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our	660.24
foolish creature he	518.27
yes yes continued lord de winter	82.50
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what misfortune is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his	154.54
shall call him	162.42
do not you recollect came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as come today to plead for	654.35
this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year and related to the true	95.24
here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was	233.40
his person had undergone change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were	658.38
there he said throwing louis	434.48
but your eminence replied the	50.23
the antechamber	458.89
as soon as have done will knock on one of the panes of	139.21
patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick his confidential valet	265.72
you have been in my service year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do	227.81
it only remains for me to know whether also suit you oh your excellency exclaimed baptistin	427.32
you have suffered great deal sir said franz	342.43
you are difficult to please	255.24
the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed bandages and lint and groom had gone to lens the nearest village for	438.38
doubtless may but but but do not think	137.79
edmond was intensely	2585.81
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was sort of reflection upon	425.57
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	265.29
the concierge who attended him had only been there	273.12
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before	112.38
they set out passing over the pont neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called abreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand	413.12

if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear us for guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the	114.30
artagnan shook his	64.20
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange	286.66
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard	118.24
you see it is serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the	181.50
he is going to fall cried	70.82
you are precious creature my pretty hostess and am much obliged to	330.00
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with passport signed for	253.74
false letter altogether said porthos we have not been	269.29
at the word noirtier made sign to her to	111.27
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his	362.08
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	152.83
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn or at least	119.07
give him direct invitation but do not ask me to present	212.03
but what the matter raoul said athos very	323.93
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august	382.93

sometimes albert would affect to make joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his	544.04
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	179.74
my father answered with loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two	234.43
good caderousse so much so that yesterday would not take the two hundred	103.04
de villefort her devotion to the elder	208.08

know it well so take	390.78
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di	85504.77
and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty come therefore to ask what has become of him villefort by strong effort sought to control	233.21
that is well do as have directed you	183.83
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious	220.21
should the king prove tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there	1587.77
here said milady rising with the majesty of queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for pure young girl the victim of the brutality of	390.21
anne of austria re entered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with	288.78
now sir said madame de villefort must bid you	86.72
bonacieux uttered little cry and	577.63
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into	738.93
perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other	405.55
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of	106.16
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of artagnan or rather of planchet artagnan had saved his	182.00
carriage was in readiness at the	53.04
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was	120.62
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the	531.34
yes my poor girl replied morrel come to bring and to hear bad	266.93
do you understand that my dear franz no horses he said but can we have post horses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for	355.57
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of vessel would have availed them so	338.36
monsieur artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in hollow tone monsieur artagnan shall die indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he	185.15
does the count know what answer you received yes showed it to	147.75
approach then said the messenger or will come nearer to you if you prefer	116.12
monsieur said the steward it is fatality am	110.27
you know the best harbors there are few ports that could not enter or leave with bandage over my	462.92
danglars was disagreeable certainly but know how much you care for his ill	473.85
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney	265.97
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them the scotch inquired	593.51
how much do owe this gracious prince what is there would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the	308.05
you cannot be speaking seriously athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to	157.74
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two	177.91
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the	514.06
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint	1484.82
the englishman appeared to reflect moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth consider it	352.20
dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on	338.34
by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent	587.59
the first time saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his	203.75
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is	458.65
alas he exclaimed how can restore the happiness have taken away from these poor innocent creatures god help me	518.49
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by	154.30
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards	1357.09
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed very bad	385.30
hush said grimaud he is coming	79.72
will he be at home at eight clock this evening doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were	107.30
bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by spring closed	359.88
and what will you do in that case shall pass through those who attack	111.48
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the	406.09
very easy thing if your horse isn	1525.59
hush don let us talk politics my	221.80
and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the	161.88
anne of austria returned to her oratory	244.30
man whose name is franz épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring	407.62
well too could keep servant too could have tilbury too could dine where like but why do not because would not annoy my little	948.02
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the	290.52
gentlemen and citizens set me free shall go to the louvre and strangle	336.78
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass	165.38
kitty entered to bring some	1034.77
this instant sir this instant beseech you said the old	285.26
do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three	108.39
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the	331.25
caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it am gaspard caderousse at your	214.39
perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with smile of	166.83
noirtier also have fallen victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte	423.44
and the duke smiled with smile at once sad and	187.28
they will no doubt bleed him therefore will retire for cannot endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband	429.05
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly	1927.54
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the	150.04
now barring all that mean to say she is deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which confess inclines to something softer gentler and more	867.70
quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and will conduct you to	194.76
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine	149.79
as artagnan pursued his investigations more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by horrible anguish his respiration was broken and	551.93
artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended	178.63
the duke however was not	135.35
he remembered the count of monte	24.86
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their	337.51
there are the acts signed deliver them to you without	674.67
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve	268.32
no replied artagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin wish to be there expect to get something by	185.57
monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied	239.36
in the	28.27
this musketeer had just come off guard complained of having cold and coughed from time to time	679.68
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but can be severe with him he is really	203.35
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to	89.56
grief has stunned him replied avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur	613.74
throne or the still more tragic destruction of the	1027.33
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking	477.87
remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men	239.56
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is	268.84
ah ah said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly	698.81
the tenants of the humble lodging were young couple who had been scarcely married week and seeing them dantès sighed	509.02
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the	193.51
and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted him and began the	250.01
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next	424.12
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went	126.45
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long	146.02
another flash illuminated all around	2763.33
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal	178.86
if you deprive me of that take away my life	230.56
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when strange looking man an arab negro or nubian at least black of some nation or other at signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had most wonderful	524.96
it was four clock when dantès was placed in this	74.52
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in bracket against his name edmond	383.48
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my	192.11
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise you are right in some degree when wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to go to	536.39
the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with gravity which already partook of	368.66
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of	124.58
family affair athos had invented the phrase family	1938.11
your mission is not accomplished exclaimed artagnan looking in astonishment at	162.84
have committed no	790.34
so that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old england you see how we snapped up the	259.52
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in friendly way to	178.80
therefore kitty	19163.15
not at all it interests me very much cried artagnan and at this moment have absolutely nothing to	118.14
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important	108.29
he is	1163.10
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously	424.66
the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed scar whose redness proved it to be recent	854.57
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the	307.81
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea	182.53
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes know man who will find the means of taking me from paris man have too long	294.05
de villefort how would you advise me to act asked	110.95
he arrived valentine was expecting	736.13
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith	218.49
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with	764.54
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to	207.52
well you soon become tired of singing and you take fancy to study diplomacy with the minister	671.85
artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to	202.22
milady smiled and artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that	185.36
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the	119.33
nonsense returned danglars tell you again have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that tore the paper to	187.67
must leave alone	800.24
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the	309.83
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently	382.35
artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend house shaded by mass of sycamores and clematis which formed vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like shadow issuing from the rue	360.56
ah if were but learned in theology should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur should know what doctrine he leans to and should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his	404.16
well exclaimed porthos see nothing in that very	153.60
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de	185.27
danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him	479.20
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between	475.45
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise artagnan	783.89
the four others were french and wore the uniform of	288.32
well well rochefort all is not lost and perhaps perhaps everything is for the	207.81
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by	295.18

read me	375.89
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept	415.57
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton physician shall be sent for and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for	131.07
gaetano consulted with his companions and five minutes discussion manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the	328.39

he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and	279.58
dantès repeated he edmond	643.16
the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting single	817.02
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over field of	853.53
the reference is no doubt to the	225.08
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining	291.81
because you are coward	277.44
dear friend shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of	159.60
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know	73.06
ah you are right monsieur said artagnan but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if can dispose of	63.25
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him	176.40
andrea hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some	234.84
madame de villefort is	30.32
what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we	102.29
that is doubtless our boat said	222.03
gentlemen said the queen few years ago had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of finger all these were busied in my	465.85
it was then that the door of edward room opened and head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	127.20
all fell to their	288.79
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis	175.20
major bartolomeo	16260.61

madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on	102.10
my good fellow said château renaud the count is your friend and you treat him	107.65
artagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the	108.76
how said albert whose brow reddened you	300.25
the young men sprang up and seized their	220.01
besides we must try our own	220.89
mordaunt bowed	9365.05
then shall say the duel did not take place you will say apologized to the count of monte	71.38
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos horse and that of	368.90
oh oh thought	533.74
no sire he replied alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de	264.25

not locked he cried that is	205.92
mazarin smiled but became very	256.81
we are going to execute your	66.06
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which should arrive lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the	208.79

monsieur artagnan he cried falling back step it is monsieur artagnan let him	177.64
ho ho said he good advice advice of	691.84
at the moment he went out piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by	165.22
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about	258.89
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not	336.18

long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were	1521.39
of what asked the priest anxiously and	397.34
such was albert opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change	317.12
why didn thou do as thou didst to the first man said	450.44

he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like ninny as he	637.66

almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of	326.26

this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune means of temporizing and obtaining good	208.39
know not why but feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime yes see too plainly that it does	338.23
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken	416.31
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea	219.53
your excellency does not require permit for the island is	238.76
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for	263.19

hold there carriage coming over	2142.42
oh sire exclaimed the duc de	179.75

so much the worse and so much the better it need not be said that artagnan was still thinking of the	92.30
the countess	3512.00
ah said monte cristo is not	32.16
quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on very	107.53
and what did you do with that letter put it into my	91.09
fencing boxing and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles	848.07

have only the letters of ali tepelini which have placed before you the ring token of his good will which is here and lastly the most convincing proof can offer an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military	370.20
old dantès however sprang	862.79
ah here is one of them	71.74
good day monsieur dulaurier replied	559.31
think you ought to do nothing since you exacted promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in	147.54
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to	265.51
coquenard had seen	194.79
am then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit	191.80
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is most singular	171.75
you shall have all	129.99
no do not seek any longer to discover the	131.19
noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other	81.24
if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of	518.57
these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and	758.66
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish	139.18
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their	476.95
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is	157.40
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first	368.77
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of	289.93

épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by decided feeling of avarice but that is	209.65
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of stiletto into the bosoms of his	400.88
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count stopped before the hôtel de	105.18
and now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the	183.52
do you not guess monsieur asked	83.91
monsieur artagnan murmured	158.32
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the	208.92
then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said	44.24
it shall take but quarter of an hour answer for everything madame believe me know the people they are like great child who only wants	316.81
and by doing so monsieur the governor said artagnan you will deserve well of the	178.67
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the	266.00
these last words produced prodigious effect on the	1227.10
that well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	138.87
trust you have brought this rabble to	299.27
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed deeper	927.34
thank god we don want either rope ladders or gag pears	3809.85
de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of	492.46
so strange reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her	320.10
how you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be	437.20
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this	113.73
ah maternal love is great virtue powerful motive so powerful that it excuses multitude of things even if duncan death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her	1224.13
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that fair bet	344.15
we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them	495.74
with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine room of which he double locked the	191.17
bah said albert	383.51
little acquainted as am with the habits of parisians should not have thought this the place for such	307.93
artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although	518.78
at least that will conciliate us all said	260.47
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his	491.34
but send me word should you be arrested for then will return	261.04
he was foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua	615.45
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of goat was	205.73
no no have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their	296.88
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as friend or even as father he worshiped him as	175.40
he had now leisure to look to his	170.68
and remember that am waiting for	55.74
shall kneel down to pray do not strike	433.99
come said he to the abbé am anxious to see your	60.13
it doesn surprise me said artagnan in low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had crushed the life out of his	171.51
and who has abandoned you is that it have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days have obtained proof to the contrary for which thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten	129.94
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said	256.96
was still unable to divine for what	382.20
yes raoul replied the	49.54
to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering	270.06
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the of the golden	337.70
and where are these four men ah that is what do not	65.22
at present confess that is the thing stand most in need	308.72
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous	350.59
whither would you have me go without friends without money in part of france with which am unacquainted and where have never been before oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being	244.50
it has been made up long time said	135.75
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as sentinel at his	408.98
the hinges of the door creaked and man appeared in the dress of cavalier wrapped in brown cloak with lantern in one hand and large beaver hat pulled down over his	263.07
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of	369.50
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel	175.34
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom have sent unto	585.29
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for	190.50
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of	474.52
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall call one of the servants yes replied	204.09
yes said cromwell you have done since knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been faithful friend cautious negotiator brave	255.21
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy	288.01
this corridor was guarded not by sentinel but by confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful	1143.91
no no continued the count had to avenge myself it is not thus would take	159.96
so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what happiness it is to meet again indeed it is so long	201.70
inutile desiderium	142697.00
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of	105.02
shall hear from you	221.89
will stop at the first posting house said danglars to	229.68
said caderousse astonished who told you was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye	186.23
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken great liking for the captive	209.15
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely	1393.19
don let him escape said loud	372.04
was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	151.84
laporte said anne of austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress	206.66
this to me who expected but to find blank enclosure surrounded by straight wall is assure you most agreeable	1358.07
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte	273.70
de tréville at distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that may growl at	273.09
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday an hour	311.55
and you ought to thank her	153.93
porthos drew back	441.13
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with	365.32
demoustier says and will not retard its course or disturb its	1075.14
questions and answers followed in nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé love and respect equal to his	263.25
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of	249.92
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy	191.40
where if you please behind the luxembourg that charming spot for such amusements as the one propose to	328.37
as to artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of cornet of the	175.69
the devil my dear athos you view things on the dark side	501.68
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be	79.23
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the	158.39
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit therefore he has gone and am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating	142.96
happy asked the count	70.69
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as daughter loves	270.26
do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him lead two sheep to the butcher two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with	329.62
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is	1303.22
madame replied valentine he has not even	215.63
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre	709.62
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had	223.13
full of this idea villefort face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling	252.97
just then handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de	271.70
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this	139.43
nay know not some evidence required from us	744.61
the young woman hastened to meet	53.22
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of	285.18
well shall	102.71
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his	55.35
artagnan recognized the	75.41
and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied artagnan in low voice beg you to follow	144.62
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	160.59
and of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron	242.59
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me widow any hour continued she throwing significant glance at	267.76
and what grimaud	4297.89
sign my lord and he gave him	89.94
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais	116.58
she has been punished	558.18
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the	77.82
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	226.01
and artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to artagnan to serve him as	132.50
this movement revealed the spot where winter body had	1080.57
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low voice as hardly to be heard by madame	120.70
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one can	293.96
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with	545.63
athos went to pay visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse and wrote the following letter to artagnan dear friend am about to set off with aramis on important	159.58
bring in the monsieur artagnan said the commissary to the	63.94
see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal guards have so many	255.97
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare	451.60
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the	256.60
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not	282.77
this was in fact the worst complaint of louis	427.63
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like	969.42
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery half circle inclosing the court of	941.20
an excuse for us to meet artagnan with false excuse to have to make false excuse to porthos oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant heart not wholly dead to	333.68
the first advantage had been gained by	188.49
he began his day by breakfasting substantially bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two clock he had his two horses saddled and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la	537.66
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and	158.19
monte cristo	42.19
now say if conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his	162.86
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the	78.93
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring hole through the	170.58
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to breath that could be interpreted as	254.86
laporte pointed to the child who was	83.27
albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his	240.13
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but should not have time enough to enjoy the	129.00
and when did you arrive here inquired	230.10
madame said mazarin with smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be	188.88
what am to do nothing very	150.70
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do	83.70
sir replied raoul bowing am entirely at your service assure	158.73
worthy fellows said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as loved you and be more fortunate than have been august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the	325.69
sir unless you force me think can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from his	277.85
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed shall be alone in the	126.36
he seemed scarcely five and	618.20
drink this and then take nothing more	397.00
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter	533.90
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders and on one of those lovely shoulders round and white artagnan recognized with inexpressible astonishment the de lis_ that indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had	577.53
very possibly only am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain	185.85
dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me gracious heavens another idea presents itself what if they should be his hair stood on	361.01
what the manner cried	231.93
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose	168.28
have you not let it go out of your hands	53.15
monsieur de comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not it is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this	146.42
the several members of that group were much	602.99
but the mourning said franz	741.12
also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly have not been less happy on that	148.46
then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his	201.67
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the	606.57
told you so exclaimed madame de	27.65
do you know that was plunged during day and night in dungeon of the bastille oh day and night soon pass	311.56
although he professes to be my enemy have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange	284.28
locked repeated	1482.32
not at all let us recall the exact	679.89
will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his	124.32
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so artagnan saw that he became	141.50
come beauchamp said château renaud will bet anything you do not believe word of all you have been telling	124.20
according to the count directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against	234.28
explain it	559.67
my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do ever read the papers then you will dispute the	183.18
we will judge you in spite of your	86.48
unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly	409.90
and am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance may have to directing my mind to such treason your majesty compels me to think of	240.43
the latter retained the count hand between	242.18
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and	190.83
heigh sir said artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like flock of silly mouse evading women how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of	260.40
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his	425.26
that gascon has saved queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only	489.30
valentine remained dumb and	420.70
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his	187.56
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as	258.45
it is god pleasure that things should be	161.87
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and	202.34
think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said	220.39
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of artagnan and	267.27
but first let haydée be informed that have	372.65
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met artagnan who having seen all was coming to	196.19
you are then in possession of francs asked the	90.57
but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours me and doubtless he is now at	126.66
good my dear rochefort but that is not	53.71
one evening as was looking over the wall saw young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and guessed that she was	202.20
saddled horse was fastened to the window	302.90
listen to me franz said albert am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to	215.02
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite	288.40
and now where is he gone inquired	165.88
ah really this is magnificent but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they	201.05
the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to him cry of admiration burst from every	103.41
know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to	335.43
who are you then who are you am the spectre of wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château	151.46

it is you sire who have now incurred	487.67

you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since came	514.63
you see said raoul we have done	142.43

pooh said the swiss who had needed little time to take in artagnan proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take turn with you am lieutenant in his majesty musketeers said artagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is not of rank but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours the first to return will recover his	217.00

ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet	242.53
they were passed by sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of artagnan and	144.62
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in	311.83
they were four honest soldiers each with good heart good arm and sword at the service of those who wanted	334.52
oh what is the matter cried	42.06
man who accustoms himself to live in such world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in common every day sort of attachment such as	554.11

do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that am very foolish to answer them reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps	140.78
athos made sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced	106.38
what on earth are you talking of am to fight	622.34
great pity said monte	42.02
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace	1164.33
artagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and	646.97
remember your	936.86
tried to open the door but it was locked inside then called the	185.35
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near great chair on castors very large covered with canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in quilt of brocade little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express sentiment at once lively intellectual and	1148.90
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings	117.40
the shade of cardinal	408.21
but this is frightful abuse of power no high sounding words let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to	599.57
well those studs continued	1539.23
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me are you going to leave me am going on journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count	96.89

are you going to give me lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye flash passed like	499.13
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his	174.14
porthos received all these attentions like man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as sign of	299.97
tomorrow morning start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time shall be	249.64
the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her	128.11
oh pardon me sir can scarcely realize so great	418.47
the same had been done for the queen and madame the	69.45
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with feeling of indescribable	175.21
as philosopher should like little country house cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor	1258.72
peppino followed	551.63
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour time he stopped before little isolated	260.69
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the	84.94
the two combatants had been seen in position which left no doubt of their	179.55

he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but phantom to whom he lent soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn	357.74
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain	276.29
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing	284.94
as happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than	221.67
do you think he is worth hundred pistoles yes will you sell him to me for that sum no but will play for	95.98
monseigneur said artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate	118.36
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in low	104.72
porthos looked at artagnan in	100.60
these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine death had struck like thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her	346.15
thank you sir replied the prisoner	99.64
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi	1018.32
but meanwhile	2800.54
artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the	217.00
what shall we do	176.75
quite contrite and repentant hem said the	820.46
adieu then to both my good friends said artagnan may god preserve you as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal	184.93
and why was arrested why was prisoner do not know said	206.73
what means this asked the	138.19
hence it resulted when artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with stump of sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the	248.21
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been sailor from whim and desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he	227.67

ah sir you know well would risk my life for	86.92
your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and know not what you mean said artagnan	103.08
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la	1274.30
he saluted the count with the air of man who is aware of the rank of his guest then having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the	78.83
will this promise be	845.98

while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the	227.63
eh my friend said he one never has too much	86.89
danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his	430.37
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the	346.17
business had already been going on for half an hour when he	60.73
the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting	222.77
it was in fact mordaunt whom artagnan had followed without knowing	173.81
sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him	173.64
de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me go the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	256.81

he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive	148.14
told you true replied he	173.39
he was in subterranean passage by which he was to leave	185.60
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in	162.64
tell him this gérard or rather tell him	171.51
there was not blade of grass to be seen in the paths or weed in the flower beds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little	801.78

the young man stood before her sorrowful and	276.49
well my dear viscount said monte cristo have an infallible remedy to propose to	97.08
be assured that am devoted to both these all powerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinal one of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever	223.20
assuming dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her	380.13
good evening comrade said artagnan in his most fascinating voice and	297.10
and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller	758.95
athos said the	37.24
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems	262.39
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most	527.44

upon fifty soldiers yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over shall replace	447.87
well then let us say no more about it said artagnan and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your or your	173.91
beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that come to	75.49
we look hideous said	512.48
your offer however smooths all difficulties and have only to ask you my	304.20
bravo said the	23.26
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon	435.46

you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of	53.38
artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last artagnan pulled him by the hem of his	148.63
but do you suppose carry five hundred francs about with me should want	499.42
what is this said aramis on seeing them	162.80
you prohibited my mentioning my father name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful	206.92
artagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read	507.28
second look was exchanged between athos and	290.50
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in gilded	534.18
near the merchant signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime	262.58
thanks to the garden we yet can flee have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late	231.67
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested little we can	600.26
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady neck would be smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos	613.09
milady clarik received artagnan	11393.12
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common	940.28
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor door and knocked	432.74
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurator wife with	134.24
danglars but am quite as incredulous as he	160.40
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp	593.43
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his	225.53
did you come to tell us you have procured carriage asked albert lighting his	234.83
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention share of his prize money but jacopo refused it	571.97

take it such as it is for have not the time to procure you	96.42
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words but imperfectly caught shall be delighted to answer	278.22
as result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to certain degree of	378.32
overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway enough said mercédès enough edmond believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and tell you freely that the comparison draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest	279.11
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert	124.19

of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial	924.52
and what friends awaited him without he had friends then five years in prison if that were so he was indeed highly favored	442.79
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be	514.83
amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and am sure you will understand me artagnan was the getting from this woman kind of blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of	184.60
his eyes dilated and shudder ran through his	319.84
let us go and die with them said the	32.93
then saw no more but heard the noise of breaking	319.97
ah blood how you have hurt me my shoulder quite	799.36
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger	887.60
no dear morcerf you know only refuse when the thing is	164.46
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years	137.51
and too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is	168.18

very well said the cardinal and you monsieur aramis monseigneur being of very mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me wound with sword treacherously across my left	451.22
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent	1046.35
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet	105.94
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and	135.04
this very instant	612.62
listen captain baldi there one way of settling this said	2134.24
porthos as we have seen had character exactly opposite to that of	280.72
oh dearest marie she thinks of me then five years of separation heavens there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his	738.73
he opened drawer and took out	887.88
see you to tell you that everything separates us the depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of	235.40
there go two miscreants said he it is pity they are not really related then an instant of gloomy reflection come will go to see the morrels said he think that disgust is even more sickening than	370.32
he had been struck to the heart by frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran death recurred to him these symptoms to less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of	164.99
to get away you would not mind you added knocking down door or	772.59
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger remarked	190.44
anne questioned artagnan by	927.54
carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage	298.62
understand said the	15.49
the sultan the liberty of woman replied the count the pope the life of man so that once in my life have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of	128.00
have received no orders on that	369.59
are you priest asked	141.27
it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other	348.66
perhaps you had spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem	198.68
your excellency carriage is at the door said	69.13
monte cristo stopped and examined it	225.77
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my	83.05
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went	118.52
de salvieux to do	313.54
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet artagnan had recognized the voice of his old	156.17
it was dark and silent as the	144.45
the guards of the cardinal and why so asked porthos	170.77
mousqueton sir answered voice from the depths of the	143.53
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his	405.34
no replied monte cristo god grant may not have done too much	149.47
but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make plume for his	661.45
he was accompanied by two of the yacht	185.00
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the	226.36
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of	192.49
no monsieur replied the young man will remain with monsieur le	79.58
the count listened and said no	168.95
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or	282.72
the cousin was received with resignation that was	238.91
stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had not been told that when you travel much it is	107.25
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat	319.95
everyone expected an explosion on carlini part but to their great surprise he took glass in one hand and flask in the other and filling it your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the	331.27
ah he ll come round thought artagnan that not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to artagnan with his hand and addressing the two	231.35
you know dear artagnan am nothing more than good honest country	265.25
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created peer and this marriage broken off without reason being assigned yes it is all from the same	308.48
hush hush replied franz we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes as franz spoke he heard the sound of door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young	193.52
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence	272.67
oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count take	179.29
you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with	1711.16
avrigny would not accuse anyone speak only of an accident you understand of mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to	262.76
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are lot of	229.53
then shall really have them oh well said the count do not think you have yet known the want of	85.92
then there is no revenge our conditions said no revenge you will please to	243.60
all that you tell me of those by whom am surrounded monsieur artagnan is doubtless true said the queen but have confidence in you	123.36
do you wish to go	10.83
here are the horse hoofs again it seems athos he said	606.01
did you bet oh merely paltry fifty	3509.64
then was heard great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself	657.94
and that father is well caderousse it is monte	149.63
the banker uttered groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor	1645.37
what make the first advances said the	93.51
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded	1097.37
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of	146.97
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and	171.11
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her	209.65
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle robe and spend all your time reading your	272.43
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly	391.81
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was	180.95
how can he be the son of great lord natural	363.72
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the	320.87
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other	610.38
sir said he that man has been	33.45
athos put his arm around aramis neck and embraced	238.23
death alone can separate them remarked	1818.00
around in the crevices of the rocks grew few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of	1269.90
oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been crime we will investigate	195.56
come then said the prince let us lose no	48.23
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of	260.97
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full	391.35
but not before one clock replied	165.29
thinking of all this and from time to time giving touch of the spur to his horse artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at	311.84
oh he was not gentleman ll answer for it besides he did not wear sword and the others treated him with small	208.05
de saint méran said madame de villefort then this house belonged	50.91
have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen	248.60
great god cried artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	750.89
one may be jailer or keeper and at the same time good father and	212.49
the trial at eight clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp	97.57
ah monsieur hypocrite understand how you study	3494.48
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner	267.52
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	118.98
it is but christian charity replied artagnan not to lead one neighbors into	850.93
the young people uttered cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again	157.60
this time will know the assassin and will pursue	168.77
no said morrel is someone dead in his house the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great	179.55
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten	141.71
shall you see the king again	66.75
in two days and by using up two or three horses that nothing have plenty of money am at	267.91
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to	117.93
what could you do against dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh they should kill	731.35
if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile am the bearer of an order of arrest and although most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be	527.25
quite so replied the	159.29
instead of aiding the movements of my horse paralyzed them and was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until	236.76
he sees us on the road which leads him to bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his	140.03
and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes can easily comprehend	365.76
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	185.62
but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her	757.47
now whither do you conduct me into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of	465.91
and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and am come to france to seek	359.98
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the	139.66
has mankind treated me as brother have men loved me have they spared me has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands no madame they struck me always struck me woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that ought to blush well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others never rest till have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their	440.86
explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful business you had such warlike	1069.26
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of man of no	254.85
in very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the	79.51
morrel shook his head	500.45
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them learned it	263.60
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of artagnan who however placed himself between him and	214.54
good god to imprison him monseigneur why he imprisoned himself swear to you he	342.30
yes sir will give my attention to the	74.80
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of naval	177.94
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already	504.77
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had kind of repugnance to	258.52
no no look look the recommendation was	1287.54
and you porthos faith am going to fight because am going to fight answered porthos	243.12
the sergeant began to	186.85
our blow has failed for to night let us	401.54
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the	337.65
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men faces and figures as very good specimen of his	347.08
hum said gondy laughing was not aware my alms were so well	415.98
no said	182.15
now saddle the other three	400.53
he had retired at one clock under the pretense of being	170.34
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an	112.26
yes but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and one name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that muttered	611.31
oh yes said de winter for they are the same	43.10
do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will	279.63
valentine tell him if you love	142.65
you suit me very	265.66
has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has scar on his	932.06
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost	505.64
morrel looked at his watch which wanted quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past	325.81
indeed still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed	366.20
by whom by bonaparte or at least by his	697.38
although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the	520.44
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing	291.80
ah ah said the cardinal know of whom you	58.14
have you no idea whatever none at	331.42
but what know is that promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are	51.67
the valet ran	3486.17
see what is going on monsieur artagnan said	33.64
the sergeant of this company veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of	380.39
let me see	45.01
here to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and	166.76
well will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but will not drink	200.76
milady secret chapter	13664.70
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palais cardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to	43.04
tell him all this for me for these are things which king cannot say for	243.56
courage we have them but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have	270.83
go to england join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every	348.27
de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with	207.49
lord de winter tore his	128.32
morrel said he do not forget what you have just	23.92
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	89.70
oho said they not in bed at quarter past	332.83
do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest	392.23
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and	150.42
come caderousse no nonsense said	350.33
it was situated in very private	358.24
go to it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said	131.08
did you drink some	269.69
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre	370.77
then turning to the baroness may ask how mademoiselle danglars is said	149.56
plan of campaign chapter	4107.01
at the same time he pointed to window through the shutters of which faint light	146.34
what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	124.31
athos porthos and aramis having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such disturbance that the provost of the castle rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much	260.01
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him	270.96
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the	272.55
four large vessels recently built had just been	3422.28
now to see things which cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my	432.84
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the	71.58
but do not keep raoul with	104.78
light cloud passed over the count	266.29
it is impossible gentleman could have written such letter to	246.24
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you	172.33
come on come on said artagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps have not thrown away my half	307.08
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the	453.07
this commissary was man of very repulsive mien with pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the	993.82
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the	373.27
give your orders and we will execute	85.67
rave said morrel well then appeal	217.68
you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around	299.51
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state	376.29
de tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me	68.29
at solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the	81.83
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it	459.12
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was	123.99
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend	259.66
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us	479.61
and that ghost told me morrel that had lived long	455.95
knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten	69.35
but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie saw you arranging deposit is not that the term of five millions and half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable paper did not dazzle my eyes like	279.27
de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence therefore sent them to the king	287.84
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	203.88
you are fifty five years	123.96
yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken	165.72
artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	397.53
you are poor and your future prospects are dark and	533.86
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional	1154.90
then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port	612.12
well what would you have me do said the	73.59
it is not who	121.09
artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed sign of	994.76
madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech shall convince your majesty trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at	229.16
comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that	1122.68
yes returned	338.04
that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your	476.04
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the	164.35
artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the	88.03
te deum for the victory of	435.79
edward he stammered edward the child did not	276.42
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or	201.19
why then didn you reply because these horses are not to be sold was the	210.74
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as vice becomes almost virtue when looked at in the light of maternal	238.55
this time without knowing why artagnan felt cold shiver run through his	1066.38
he opened his mouth to reply but with haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	319.41
artagnan made violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too	341.31
he felt something like secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous	1137.83
against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself whom would they hang yourself or me well can weather the storm whom notwithstanding you tax with fear not with bravado that is not my way but am	577.91
it concerns the best interests of your father said the	150.22
do you wish to see him only wish to be	28.79
what do you want asked he with more sorrowful than angry	200.36
and at the third she	362.19
aramis cried athos am	177.67
dark or fair dark very dark with black eyes black hair black	773.15
from france cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter	632.30
yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging	655.67
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can	357.82
what is it hear	375.69
tis raoul who has come back said athos and we can now hear how the poor child	103.15
federal laws and your state	980.43
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less sum than fifty piastres	519.94
to donate please visit	12854.30
de morcerf in epirus for guilty as knew he was thought you had no right to punish him but have since learned that you had that	225.10
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their	250.49
what asked the host quite cheerful	692.05
and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the soissonais and that of pierrefonds in the	220.97
stir but step said they and you are dead	145.03
yes yes replied he perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she am sure of	80.61
bear witness that we have done all that we	71.73
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would	183.55
de morcerf was so proud oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of reproach in	234.59
we were then convinced my friend and that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and	126.65
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not dream or at least the delirium of	181.09
lord de winter exclaimed the	22.19
ah count said albert assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one	181.58
ah said artagnan singular	504.38
kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should do so why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst	224.93
not at	110.51
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian	415.67
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he	407.71
mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same	258.45
come have you decided said	160.15
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious	235.86
and here is andrea cavalcanti baptismal register given by the curé of	1810.76
that is more than time enough for us to devise	284.64
you are the offended party	709.20
had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and advised him to invest all he had in an	152.74
my faith said aramis we are all	136.28
during this time porthos played	243.07
take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his	136.56
it is possible said morcerf my father has in his study genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which made commentaries that would have greatly edified hozier and	348.11
he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many	391.90
support double weight the weight was not so heavy when was in peril interrupted the queen with sad smile and ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs	225.56
ask much too much perhaps for have no title to request	168.10
de tréville entered the king cabinet boldly and found his majesty in very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his	257.11
the first opportunity you have undeceive him beg and tell him am nothing of the	215.26
what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but doubt if it be his real	140.19
these important advantages artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the	231.83
on our return to france she had young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at	191.61
bonacieux we shall hear no	136.43

then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the	495.88
at last said he shall know with whom have to	121.18
artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	310.50
so that for trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg	353.49

but what is to be done said	16.57
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was viscount recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing descent and genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres more than sufficient sum to render him personage of considerable importance in	720.12

island of monte cristo all	262.11
well then tell him this	170.82
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand	250.02

his wife he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of irreproachable virtue she poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband forgiveness she was purchasing with her death villefort again groaned with anguish and	461.80
having deprived me of my liberty having deprived me of death having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair who talks of god and despair at the same time said voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man	178.00

the count then is in the chateau	129.58
well sir said arminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not	503.88
oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not	180.88
as soon as the door of gondy study was opened man rushed	244.71

no thank you gave orders for my to follow	268.54
not even for fifteen years wages come it is worth thinking about for fifteen thousand francs	384.03
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask	358.59
think of the offense you have committed toward me madame it remains said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it	153.73
anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with	294.12

then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the	158.77
valery but	687.07
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong hold had it taken of his	250.80
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his	112.55
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily am not the	109.31

swear to me then never to let them put crown upon your head unless you have legal right to the	187.32
all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he	343.78

the garden was long and narrow stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made background for the shrubs and	639.61
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning	137.62
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey yes it	165.99
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of child should not be allowed to overturn project which have entertained for so many	127.94

edmond hoped he was	324.30
an instant the man he asked for was before him booted and	603.40
why so in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation as for myself can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be torture but it is not an	365.93

when am rich will order statue of chance from klagmann or	2559.84
artagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of court could not but perceive little coldness in this	274.97
and she looked at artagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves	203.10
from distance they perceived aramis seated in melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the	391.75
look here said the	42.37
without you did you really think me capable of that at least said the abbé now see how wrong such an opinion would have	105.94
and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that am satisfied madame that he did what have told you besides that is not much more odious than that frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered	284.16
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow	281.27

someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was	116.47
ah said mordaunt with sneer there one who is	301.74
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present	1030.80
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped long sharp	587.72
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as model of	270.35
then how comes it said monte cristo with frown that when desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his	226.26

mazarin who had dispensed thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more	641.75
canst thou speak any patois can do something better than that sir can speak	663.68
am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo	193.70
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that am returned to my fundamental	196.76

because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your	185.53

all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been	190.40
and have you succeeded think	431.71
but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north that said athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the	247.67

the general depended much on it he even came to	630.12
do so then but let it be the	102.84
but it was my husband who would not hear of	162.55

the floor of the abbé cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the	194.23
oh recollect him perfectly	1357.73
man whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on	888.82

the friends went to bed early but neither of them	424.26
what will they dare to arrest man in his majesty service they did not scruple much in the case of	140.73
from this point everything was blank to dantès he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been	171.34
and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my	167.66
if he persists his eminence made pause and resumed if he persists well then shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of	335.04

porthos pressed his friend hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charles retreat was advancing to meet the english	336.06
then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind because we should run straight on to the island of	372.86

at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being	124.23
mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her	338.73

the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house she had scarcely closed the door her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same	109.78

bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her	255.87
perhaps all blood demands some	5891.02
it is quite wonderful said	108.90
he reeled back with shudder and the same moment the drops became crimson	844.03
do not want books am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but wish to see the	143.83
was not deceived said he here is monsieur artagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and	92.65
what do you think artagnan said	19.51
but you may use it replied lord wilmore understand	273.73
buckingham saw by the expression of the young man face what was passing in his mind and he	48.71
artagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and	622.90
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such fuss since give myself up and he held out his hands to be	188.41

however they left the castle behind that was the principal	326.61
she is capable of anything or	177.47
ten minutes one is taken the effect is	373.02
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of francs he stretched himself on his bed and turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was	309.44
he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to	65.86
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at	172.72
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and	638.19
he ran towards	137.01
at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini	57.83
ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then meaning to say replied dantès with smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if were not captain eh eh said caderousse shaking his	212.17
twenty five minutes past nine	487.69
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding	167.39
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in hurry am very much in	46.46
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five	1045.13
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank	322.03
he will not come in time feel my life fast	517.30
when when we have	372.79
yet replied	1484.73
certainly said morcerf recollect him	431.73
beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch courier to	462.66
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time retained consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if may say so waked in my sleeping body was that saw that	359.22
have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that am become passive in the hands of the almighty like sparrow in the talons of an	286.84
beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be	62.69
in truth the lieutenant horse stumbled and fell on his knees then rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to	218.98

the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in lighted	361.32
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing	241.86
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the	167.29
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by	236.19
where then said athos smiling if it be not	79.51
avrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the	135.43
good what clock is it four	376.77
well take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait	335.55
you were right he said my dear monsieur artagnan and you cannot set out	86.16
why what ails you asked he of	379.77

milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering	737.32
it was one of the results of mazarin	127.91
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majesty principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé and assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent	259.53
how do you know yes which catches the thief in trap and plays	982.53
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	1469.32
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more	526.55
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his	70.79
holland loved her and she responded to his	175.21
sometimes we don go to bed at all well what of that why he would be annoyed if did not play with	131.70
well then monsieur bernajoux said artagnan tranquilly will wait for you at the	155.62
la ramee knelt down and made hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by	395.29
owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are woman that can perfectly understand me will give	155.57
artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the	189.39
de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abbé busoni sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much	167.58

they carried him through an alley up flight of stairs and deposited him in an	316.34
but though he held the cardinal promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage	368.71
dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in	188.33
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the	101.79
in an hour hence shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have definite	99.27
yes the wager said the light	598.68
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at	1250.71
mazarin listened	13503.76
the army will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police	363.49
my dear count we have only just	84.19
sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of candle which traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that living being dwells beyond the silence and	437.27
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform	212.48
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed oh no for when had taken out the thread required hemmed the edges over	733.88

go to go to would rather die on straw than hoard up thousand year by being governor of the	549.86
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some	227.45
well when you receive the remaining you shall give me receipt in	189.40
it is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then remember as we remember	97.12
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go	743.54
we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio	294.79
and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de	542.77
my dear beauchamp wish you to contradict this	297.54
the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served	189.54

the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it	110.17
oh you are thorough democrat said monte cristo	185.27
yes recognized mademoiselle	558.16
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was	118.20
one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de	96.29

milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like holy virgin awaiting	1545.27
valentine will you permit me to make confidant of friend and reveal to him the love bear you valentine	214.87
yes said the paralytic with the same	140.32
what has been the result that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends	185.61
and who afterwards sent the cup to me	859.14
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide replacement copy in lieu of	1874.04
well then it is to see thing on which have sometimes mused for hours	324.21
it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow	140.09
does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no he is subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the	671.35
and why did you refuse my son inquired the old	76.01
porthos paid no	1233.97
has not your excellency heard that the french affaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes heard	476.71
and so he was murmured	198.90
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her	162.51
yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming	234.38
marseilles the arrival on the th of february the look out at notre dame de la garde signalled the three master the from smyrna trieste and	1065.38
danglars recollects having seen	833.85
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him letter here is what promised you our young friend will be extremely well	226.43
oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with	144.26
and now my good friend said artagnan to him must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and	108.96
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the	221.29
let us put down added albert	220.05
morrel to come and claim me at my own	144.57
poor fellow said	47.92
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mère simon son who has not chosen the worst	1930.65
felton grew pale and made step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had rope in her	152.05
plague stifle you and your latin said artagnan who began to feel all his patience	272.91
de villefort multitudinously is good said château	231.77
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large beard and hair so long now barber would only be surprised if man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of	432.42
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of resolute	716.26
stop see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward	290.71
yes added planchet like the famous ass of	1035.76
when the soldier saluted charles athos heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his	602.01
attend to it then at	81.57
exactly so cried	159.35
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending	189.70
yes said morrel smiling it was the th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power endeavor to celebrate it by some heroic action interrupted château	225.24
the young man who one evening sought quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the	268.73
good said the	82.18
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me	105.69
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join	422.22
why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not	69.21
well well cried artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep think it is the	155.39
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	176.93
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you	180.68
really sir artagnan said to him am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor	140.93
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately	46.93
indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us	88.25
morrel threw glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still	420.35
am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and have promised to adhere to his	353.17
one of the persons whose conversation overheard was the master of the house the other the	143.69
you are adorable	692.72
these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	557.33
le duc de la	106.78
do you think so asked the	32.09
no sire replied	73.39
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with loose rein in other	280.43
there will be no necessity for me to make note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me have the plan sketched with all the living reality of	308.20
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant	289.55
wretch exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go	145.57
what do you say inquired charles	155.79
as artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been	142.23
perfectly well quite rested	1518.17
artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed	221.55
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	165.16
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around	84.65
this could not then be military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular	388.45
since you demand my resignation	2122.29
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponent weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in form apparently so feeble but thanks to parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his	299.68
he has come thought	299.55
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and	273.94
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our	267.79
it is certainly the king said the man rising	68.72
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of post chaise is an	714.70
as to bazin he went and lay down on truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with cardinal	362.76
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was beginning of vengeance which filled his	282.58
speak italian	1684.50
she soon whispered to her husband think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in	111.59
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	643.62
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe blow through her husband and	194.68
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do	109.34
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man am artagnan don you know me where is your master you monsieur artagnan cried grimaud	135.94
you don choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned artagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my	198.46
speak speak one can say anything to	174.40
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of	120.47
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	177.50
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and	218.09
six hours he left pierrefonds he was at saint	287.99
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue	128.27
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first	242.06
single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	150.54
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we	95.76
don believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial trial would make noise and noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de	276.58
thou mayst add that thou hast risked it	4427.40
in quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and	179.52
silence and fatigue together overcame artagnan and sleep overtook him	1987.63
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it duty for me to offer you my	382.22
in an instant space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family	517.23
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad	220.88
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their	303.30
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of friend who tried to persuade him that the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two	221.99
well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which rode	271.15
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such glance as is best understood by mortal	426.98
benedetto he muttered fatality half past six clock has just	643.59
are you large party	2247.76
the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate	348.70
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to	136.46
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort would follow him to hell and that is saying not little as believe him entirely capable of the	252.99
we even joked very pleasantly if remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my	678.33
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing	304.84
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance she knew him she knew that at her return from fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had	319.01
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and mistrust	542.54
leave your hold then beg of you and let me go where my business calls	135.58
and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to	360.85
trust me don let us try to do things	384.63
oh sir said artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and	123.58
then shall believe god has forgiven you and will forgive you	500.18
speak now the queen herself releases you from your	390.96
nor said	27.66
chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as	139.50
furthermore artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with	369.94
it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through black	335.26
believe me you ought now to take	173.88
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us	245.54
yes said	62.27
and porthos heaved another	2529.39
yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please	230.53
it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of	198.24
mazarin disappeared as they rose from	301.98
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each	354.92
it is horrible indeed but no one	422.64
then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made sign of	347.99
it was the count de	45.17

de tréville was asking artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an	141.84

buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered	167.93
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the	362.81
and you couldn remember	964.97
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is	252.09
let us try not to jest if we	126.83
what do you wish sir asked morrel that should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtier eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his	259.27
do you think so answered artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt	297.74
but where will you manage to stow me in the chamber	341.31
this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not look from monte cristo silenced	344.63
very good said the	22.12
monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid	221.49
morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime	119.92
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his	146.59
and aramis pushed forward large easy chair in which artagnan stretched himself	458.59
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his	81.63
de tréville was as gay and cheerful as	243.39
bravo you ve killed him	888.31
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet	77.20

mazarin returned pale and evidently	602.53

danglars turned slightly pale andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing	597.76

had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down	240.34

he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching milady bed offered her	139.28
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him	194.49
monte cristo wrote die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon	856.51
ah you remain in london said	100.55

you persist then yes am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go	162.83
if it were not so far from here to the house would return and finish	119.01
the throng was terrific and it was not till much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their	608.14

witty he has unfortunately too much	512.21
what telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory oh no should find there people who would force me to understand things of which would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself mystery which even they do not	266.91
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for support superior to the danger which threatened	233.07
his father was introduced to me as marquis so he ought to be count but do not think he has much claim to that	130.25
one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to	234.04
to you alone then may confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned	823.34
very well be here at	284.45
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them cup of	733.23

monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt	499.87
if judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against	138.44
one thing was sorry for when bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little	211.86
de comminges went away artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be	212.53
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped	328.21
had acted hastily towards	838.00
read said he read cannot	215.61
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the	194.07
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and well you the cardinal would have given you letters of	238.46
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before	272.78
and in justice to villefort it must be understood	103.27
am credited on you for six	386.22
ho friend cried	265.70
no no you do yourselves injustice but am here to do you	319.39
as friend and only as friend at this	151.66
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time let us see what this letter	297.83
should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had divulged my own apprehensions to	857.44
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	61.37
that pretty positive continued artagnan but all it is but	513.16
when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her having looked at them	176.98
franz gave him albert	485.84
he is walking about and thinking thought artagnan but of what it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not	160.06
here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were	1397.22
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to	487.06
de tréville being there to claim	243.78
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the	49.07

coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of good	414.05
then while passing he had cast rapid investigating glance into the kitchen and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurator wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good	259.94
disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued artagnan for by what see am led to believe that you are confessing to these	103.32
he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah see here is madame returning with	620.23
oh how distinctly remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and feel as if it were still warm on my	205.49
well asked	94.17
oh merciful heavens murmured	4768.99
but must	738.46
it was soon time for grimaud to recall the	202.27
parry too started and stopped	1505.63
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions	528.51
pretend to sleep louis said	252.68
my mother gave it to me and fool as was instead of keeping the ring as holy relic gave it to this	261.52
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of	329.35
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and will ask	79.47
you demanded favor said the baron	1336.48
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to	326.88
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the	509.89
to questions frankly put said he straightforward answer should be	1592.77

not breath of wind now disturbed the heavy	3263.26
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said	127.44
it was	188.66
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry	164.17
what is it to leave behind you the diamond you have on your	84.38
great people only thank you for doing the impossible what possible they say they can effect themselves and they are	230.65
what is he then with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying letter to lord de winter he has set up little shop in the rue des lombards and is now	226.77
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same	155.53
will send	287.92
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no	1519.67
the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell falsehood we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our	168.51
they know that am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why did not invite	106.19
oh said scarron he may die	177.34
although was without mistrust vague fear seized me and tried to struggle against	1270.32
but let it be done explicitly and	513.91
here it is my	22.66
say no more entreat	152.93
what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth either misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against	530.20
milady saw the	194.13
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was	166.66
and too added	734.04
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by	180.35
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first father then	128.28
there is not hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so	216.78
but am grateful swear to	150.24
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in	640.19
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned	204.12
what is that that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this	157.34
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to seat placed another for	175.12
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as thing already	311.53
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his	228.81
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around	69.92
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden	156.03
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long space of time that they might now come and crush me with this	243.84
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest search search but what have done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither dream nor reality what have done to you tell me then speak you condemned me to horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and	251.79
then he must be	160.98
when you have purchased the estate desire want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern	1181.58
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without	179.06
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard noise of people and the carriage	100.34
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses	173.67
the king threw himself into an arm	190.63
ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad	142.78
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to	191.77
the de lis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices	475.81
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	271.68
it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to call his jailer attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity unfortunately edmond brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in	250.89
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times and from that date up to the present day hundred times perhaps so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is	284.95
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around recognized the honest	378.18
now who was that someone that was the question the three musketeers put to one	173.84
you are not boasting do you wish for proof	141.71
did not wish to contradict them besides might be	142.76
ah that is	28.55
oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won get them at	222.00
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four	351.24
your eminence may believe added artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few	164.55
the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of charles still	1194.84
yes yes but now what did do with that letter artagnan thought moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old	183.53
nevertheless he pressed artagnan hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment can only do for you that which just now	153.01
now that never happened to us when we were four	126.39
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his	189.09
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud artagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly	692.99
creek to the east in right	358.46
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no	398.12
when he is absent am	136.26
spectre against spectre he murmured in low voice as he concluded his	456.57
you see we were quite right to pacify that	268.07
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his	392.32
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in	223.60
well said albert with sigh it seems you are determined to marry	66.51
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other	105.32
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in low	95.78
laporte place the king in	164.52
my whew that frightful place that bastille only to think of it makes my flesh	990.63
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are	217.40
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush	377.56
yes just	816.43
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound will listen to him with the greatest	197.98
adieu till we meet again apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that should have requested you to acquaint him that in short time he will see whether am as he says too old for	223.32
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortune at least so it is said and beg you to observe that do not inquire merely repeat it is not usual say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this	406.73
and my faith the governor of the province one of the gentlemen expected today seemed to have such wish for him that gave him to	120.13
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle	1153.84
he has slept long time on hard bed so he won object to soft one take every care of him beg of	511.31

but do as he has made me baron and field marshal and shall never forget that for these two titles am indebted to his happy return to	301.59
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second	182.69
commend me to the	22.71
when the hour of breakfast came therefore did not hesitate to eat and	332.03
and that one if mistake not	1112.88
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much	480.95
speak will	448.21
there was moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing	149.92
at what hour shall we come asked the young	54.92
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of	246.88
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur	472.24
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	313.78
inside the cup was small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to	491.08
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the	508.75
the famous secretaire is in the dressing	395.91
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in	300.49
go and fetch	246.95
but he was man of	106.33
that is also	232.80
bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless	206.04
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat	184.79
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or	445.56
because you do not love me madame if you loved me you would view all this	94.85
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with shade of	206.58

she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in duel in the place royale by the duc de	276.67
then you feel pretty much as you generally do you have had the dose which am accustomed to give you every sunday	252.08
but because you have paid the price of slave do you imagine that have ceased to be your king	146.68
but come expressly for that	923.09
then his admirable nature underwent complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the	425.87
anne then motioned to artagnan to approach and he	251.45
the rest concerns myself don be uneasy about	671.93
the reward of his devotion that of his love was to	140.14
what is it	161.65
ay and very fine one saw him yesterday your friend lackey was leading	691.76

but what could these men whom at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the	184.28

it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in	295.74
that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses you see travel with	151.18
but perhaps you have never loved child replied the	91.14
we dispense with your saying	1762.62

while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard murmur of words which at length fixed his	444.75
de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the	263.39
he is writing she	172.29

each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventy five pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time	176.10

then taking passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months	459.45
finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed kiss upon the paper mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the	313.26
yes yes see him well enough said	169.16
faith yes with haughty presence fine equipage such as the son of noble house would	586.38
what is he waiting for what is he looking at good god have they allowed the headsman to escape suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the	502.49
gentlemen said	10.50
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that	215.41
he is black and cannot speak returned monte	187.54
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish	267.11
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be	171.41
and when he shall have informed him and monsieur laporte is come you will send him to	73.88

milady looked at this man and	67.17
gondy had not walked hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of	118.52

count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed	236.42
wait minute then said	131.10
as usual valentine strolled for short time among her flowers but without gathering	997.31
well ask your worthy jailer what favor this instant solicited of	1132.58
my son she said persons in the count situation have many secret	411.74
one would have said andrea anticipated his companion words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for	274.12
he felt carpet under his feet door opened perfumes surrounded him and brilliant light dazzled his	673.67
nevertheless monsieur de tréville company of musketeers alone cannot maintain war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without	221.53
well then let us	103.79
we must let monsieur de beaufort	127.60

you must see that to be an utter impossibility said	173.21
had been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo must believe on seeing	130.07
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at	132.22
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which morrel by the deputy procureur advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort certificates rendered	651.70
give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned	107.94
this was the room appropriated to the	225.00
we will wait then said	70.27
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the	141.93
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of artagnan who arose and replied consider it worthy conduct of pupil of	575.10
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of	477.73
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for would tell her that loved you and she would protect	153.22
will say likewise he had apprised the count by note of your intention and the count being absent read the note and sat up to await	281.49
he rose however as they	236.39
very true replied the gascon but always run away from	240.40
it is not madame bonacieux about whom am anxious cried artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one the	209.21
stop stop cried artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several	1682.23
twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer	505.91
at that time was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me however because was prudent you must not take me for	171.96
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady illness yes said the old	225.54
it concerns nothing less said artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	162.08
who could intercept us on such night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at	334.24
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had great respect for	121.02
said looked upon it as sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps	2487.06
said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me louis on	371.35
grimaud nodded	59827.91
where does he live rue férou two steps from	1156.27
this is terrible said	70.00
who was looking on an eager and curious spectator who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy who like wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course was watching and bitten to the heart morrel	656.09

you know well that don like to leave things half	564.28
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still	203.89
what do you think artagnan asked	24.73
besides our supper can delay you	1109.70
never swear my lord say yes or no and as am gentleman keep my	285.73
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god that is the reply beg you to make to lord de	117.21
morrel to be	162.74
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the	197.92
what is the matter exclaimed artagnan anxiously what has happened to you my lord all is lost cried buckingham becoming as pale as corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	171.26
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his	149.66
the baron took the pen and signed then the	314.62
but replied felton wish to	98.88
what resist my father order and my dying grandmother wish impossible morrel	1546.85

you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely was far from france at that	402.24
porthos opened his mouth to reply artagnan made him sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually	432.50
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de	118.85
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and	56.41
in second la ramee was gagged and laid	1481.51
albert could not understand the banker look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can tell you because imagine you have correspondents in that	137.15

my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of strange disorder which left livid traces all over the	523.76
draw upon him for francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of francs payable at his correspondent in paris at the end of this	249.12
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her	376.44
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back	379.03
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of	527.76
dare not say more in	209.78
they had not long to wait for an	91.41

now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while for my part would rather it should be	194.82
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the	359.59

on the other bank replied the	120.61
are you really frightened madame said monte	70.81
knew lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this	676.97
you are right	297.18
why if parisian were to indulge in quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone	609.86
how well you reason said porthos	472.40
épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of husband indeed fear valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter assure	270.03

it seems like woman they search her she resists they use force the scoundrels in spite of his prudence artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking part in the scene that was going on	494.85
but the chief without taking the money made sign to him to	122.57

my first duty directly had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and clung to life partly on my sister account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our	347.95

in the month of july the devil said	64.78
is there anything new in the wind	537.45

but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see the worthy mercer	284.44
benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his	230.28
she wished to know when her lover would meet her second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited artagnan	306.51
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the	194.34

ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of malignant spirit which bids us	386.91
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released	338.47
but since you say nothing remains but	196.00
for monsieur de wardes said	106.47
épinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own	215.49
monte cristo advanced few steps which were heard on the	112.14
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying	61.84
princes must be knocked on the	75.32
admirable said	18.09
morrel asked his daughter for the key of his	83.44
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would give up five years of my pay which am never paid by the way to make the king five years	128.66
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as prince of the holy see or sultan of the and one	645.78
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the	178.64
he was man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by	300.55
then you did not see either of them no but madame de morcerf saw	64.61
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the	133.15
and athos have not yet seen	134.01
yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance	183.64
he told how he had rendezvous with young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the	190.56
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments king more majestic than kings by	476.65
one day you will be able to understand how all this	51.68
they threw themselves into each other arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the	272.83
to old times he	361.29
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman little	442.06
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	319.34
sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir she was my mother her crimes know them not her disorders know them not her vices know them	574.07
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to certain point could not dissemble have learned some fine things concerning your	347.71
noirtier yes think you it was the poor servant life was coveted no no like shakespeare polonius he died for	723.02
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but	95.86
my faith said athos have nothing to say against	156.46
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he	176.47
she fell into so deep reverie that her eyes gradually	486.71
short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz	219.94
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman	135.85

you would love me as much if were poor would you not maximilian oh shall always love	214.28
he began as you	476.23

the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being first rate sailor she yet was tolerably	515.78
hear me athos said	40.66
he has about him little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german	746.44
this is what you asked for he said and what promised to give	78.34

milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	190.93

on these days he spoke	150.29
well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so	62.73
artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked	166.28

artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud	267.07
do you doubt my word he	37.18
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even	142.63
you know porthos could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so merely said they were fifty and we were	207.22
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling table and two benches composed the entire	697.48
the weather was dull and stormy cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the	431.39
you were still fast asleep and did not know what to do with myself was still stupid from our yesterday	316.01

the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before	689.05
that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul	125.33
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved	294.26

my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen	74.55
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his	229.10
may be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit dinner through the crevices of the door may be hanged if can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the	308.34
what do you mean to do with that purse whispered	82.80
how asked blaisois can explain	927.99
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when dispense with all foolish human	910.10
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank	138.55
but the secret said	74.10
when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to	335.71
one night however heard his sobs and could not resist my desire to go up to him but when reached his door he was no longer weeping but	193.90
will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have with pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be	247.85
rapid change took place in the young man	207.11
artagnan called the	354.71
no make you my lieutenant general said the	180.66
he went into his cabin and came back with brace of	187.52
gale more than that we shall have tempest or don know what	145.25
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and	433.63
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	344.36
my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are	210.63
sign it	90.05
good said he it was time and he sealed his will with three	283.44
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two	111.59
this is indeed house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already	765.36
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by staff almost as brilliant as	549.95
there the article of remunerations and to be discussed and set to	485.35
stop gentlemen said albert have two words to say to the count of monte	40.60
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with strange and amazing	334.00
impossible cried all the guests	960.63
de tréville entrance he turned	219.14
the monk seemed agitated by strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put question which yet he dared not	701.11
then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the	333.80
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said	161.40
listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me what have	120.24
ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that	96.40
yes replied	3338.73
then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god mournful sob burst from villefort heart he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine turn your daughter cried avrigny with grief and	299.92
to his	134.11
emmanuel accompanied me	1101.64
what did your excellency say inquired the	87.39
so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting son in law respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say must try and fancy tis your dear hand kiss as it should have	281.00
feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own	122.16
the fifth sharer in edmond bequest was his own	1235.78
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably	256.97
it was the only letter you had it	84.18
no monsieur no am not called louis the just without	497.76
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own	320.66
if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required different alliance to aid his career if louis	995.22
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in	267.98
oh my god must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands yes yes madame you must and will save them	149.22
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling	191.82
then for the	97.38
madame have never been false to my word when say will not do thing mean	236.50
so much the	65.62
faith no said artagnan was not in voice monsieur du vallon has cold and did not cry	165.64
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as	266.45
andrea pricked up his	549.68
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary	537.49
have placed reliance upon you my	201.95
de tréville where he had	105.94
would anything retain you particularly in paris nothing but an order from superior would retain me in	458.88
bonacieux giving to his countenance most sly	1088.39
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the	284.44
at this order given in athos habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos brow grew	787.30
cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the	497.02

when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his	121.38
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with self satisfied	670.16
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen	69.98
they passed into the eating room large dark room situated opposite the	420.40
noirtier did not love his child and yet he	158.63
that fellow has decidedly bad countenance said the count in tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory	344.13
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs whilst artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present	201.25

the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging last	1471.68
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving	283.43
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and sank upon the floor prey to slumber which resembled	1144.12
on the contrary it is matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old	91.29
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from place in which he has fixed his	174.04

he hastened to descend into the street with frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of	137.40
he was dressed in doublet and hose of violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt	514.67
moment afterwards he heard noise in the drawing room and went to open the door	75.94
you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your	49.14

young man said richelieu if shall be able to say to you at another time what have said to you today promise you to do	56.80
then said albert you became the property of this man no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to	166.92
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his	150.49
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady	156.61
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our	310.38
the gate opened carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the	204.08

silence herblay cried athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as	240.82
they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with most pitiable air was driving before him mule and	258.85
without the saddle said	139.24
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his	367.66
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked	282.82
set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and took post horses with my servant tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in	507.80
and you have discovered means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dantès	259.67
the fair indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of	1111.72
this chancellor was pleasant	1196.55
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god	438.02
join the escort cried	164.74

poor things here am in their name	206.71
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the	82.10
and the corridor on	551.84
could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton little	304.28
the watchword is king and	1609.17
went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten clock to	91.99
did they speak of me not	151.10
grimaud in swoon was tied securely to	2744.80
very well only do not give me false information as you did the other	90.88
ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the or the but spare my future father in law before	635.74
but said danglars there is still sum of one hundred thousand francs oh mere nothing said monte	104.34

what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me read me her	262.42
he wants to be sure that go away said artagnan to	85.91
haydée is very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is kind of baptismal name as you parisians call	508.29
capital cried the gascon you would make distinguished	247.91
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry	1644.18

you are	33.01
they traced her to châlons and there they lost	675.99
she passed an hour without breathing panting with cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the	403.08
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of father who thinks that he may perhaps get cheap idea concerning new toy for his	495.42
what rank did he hold on board he was	606.91
what are you doing asked	103.68

that where we	70.91
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host	719.77
who is that man he	50.17
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned	499.86
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican	378.17
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of small stream flowing into the	578.78

then must wait asked the young	40.44
and yet we must be drawing near the	235.35
but you only asked francs for fowl we have fixed price for all our	457.36
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way	352.80
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much	187.48
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and	118.99
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore will not speak more fully	338.40
but is not your eminence going to the queen for what purpose monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the	98.79

does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with brow flushed with	344.78
my lord added henrietta with melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted	282.16
anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to	278.83
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming	252.25
but if he should be cavalier said	62.21
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell	538.20

villefort looked at valentine as they said	109.01
this last expression of richelieu conveyed terrible doubt it alarmed artagnan more than menace would have done for it was	445.52

did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the	282.04

perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for	456.53
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by	193.30

valentine looked at her	105.22
villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him	539.79

if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he	178.84
they exchanged bows and artagnan returned to his	261.88

noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to sound and faithful	794.98

she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of	156.70

my lord who told you that nobody but know	96.76
paltry piece of business murmured artagnan crumpling his	825.22
madame danglars threw rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were friend of mine should ask you if you would sell your	167.42
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of artagnan without speaking word on the journey you may think what you will sir but can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his	127.44

one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no	763.70

these thoughts gilded as they were by last reflection of love were not the less	391.75
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and will return and finish the last	255.57
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself	154.89
the abbé took the	145.35
all at once tall dark gentleman just like yours	1197.51
morrel the justice to say that he ran still	315.39

you are not priest cried the	73.36
you are deceived lucien assure you replied madame danglars and what have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which did not think it worth while to allude	204.39

friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me was wrong hundred times	250.92
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing fishing song of which his companions sung the	433.56

officer cried	290.91
monsieur continued dantès know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all	86.88
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by	213.59
and on what will you sleep said	83.25
but before setting out he reflected that for lad of intelligence and experience he was in singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind	655.32

he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	487.04
de villefort all seek is	1056.04
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but swear to you that this crime shall be her	166.16
be it so then replied athos	248.38

artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing	110.56
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest	423.53
you will see what fellow he is man who nearly killed mazarin between two	267.01
it had been resolved the night before to change their	316.90

the stronger reason why it should be sold replied	488.93
then bring some wine said	197.38

gentlemen there was profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other	187.57
my dear doctor there is no communication	236.03

do you fear he will not understand	68.58

but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary	57.37
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might	129.85
before he had spoken word the count saw in the next room veiled woman who had followed closely baptistin and now seeing the count with pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed	139.42
monsieur said the cardinal are you artagnan from béarn yes monseigneur replied the young	85.14

in one fashion or another you have terrible enemy on your	367.48
they lost her yes	2714.65
still further in buckingham lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised	767.19
tent was erected for them near that of the	229.17
they threatened me with	971.83
must seem to you by no means curious but assure you that it is not my fault have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the	132.12
god say the devil my dear friend said artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you	88.00
who are you who are you said the	58.68
the count opened the letter and	40.63
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to	100.84
yes you are right artagnan fatality that will separate and ruin us so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to	219.04

five months he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès	135.04
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some	292.65
your excellency yes	84.83
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained	153.37
have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that might test your character and then surprise	314.55
you are the directors of all	341.55
artagnan went out first as had been agreed	154.38
and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as love you	187.09
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his	192.22
told you so athos said artagnan shrugging his	91.41
but is she safe asked the	178.44
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to	354.70

but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like fatigued serpent in	974.33

de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers moment silence no sir we do	199.42

the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could	293.59
you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the	90.11
and when shall we know inquired	333.64
that is reasonable said the visitor have heard he had three or four	137.68
actually love no one sir you know it do you not do not then see why without real necessity should encumber my life with perpetual	263.87

she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her	182.88
the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with characteristic british stride towards the street	903.13

the president sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general and had no	256.16
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and ray of the moon was reflected on the shining	194.64
ah pardieu said artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very	78.05
morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the	121.06

how so said	152.08
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will	50.05
the death of your prince	211.55
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching	89.72
de salvieux my brother chamberlain yes	1856.87
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as	441.83

foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to	52.01
de morcerf said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his	318.12
artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three	513.91
no but we shall make use of them said	40.65
épinay went on you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against	179.31
do you know villefort that you are talking in most dreadfully revolutionary strain but excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of girondin to be free from small spice of the old	235.32
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that	711.99
yes monsieur know only	530.87
but with the rapidity of thought artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to	347.64
what has happened all sorts of	407.32
your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting	190.60
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our	274.72

ho ho exclaimed artagnan picking up louis and displaying it here louis that smells confoundedly of	1967.00

good thought the gascon this is promising	650.67
there is still something else said	68.52
the marquis of saint méran returned the	44.30
you are generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what have right to offer you will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and	129.11
one moment beg for here are the chevalier herblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal	187.28

then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed thousand pardons really did not observe whom had the honor to receive under my poor	395.59
this time maximilian was the first to	164.46
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor	168.55
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in	223.28
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like bottle of wine with red seal franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of	461.95

de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which artagnan had left him little	70.86
downstairs in the	232.77

he was without hat carried sword and flourished handkerchief in his	455.98
why because there is little secret precaution thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse will manufacture you similar one when you are	1326.85
he strove to collect band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to	853.84
respect old age but don much like it boiled or	1725.43
have if it were only possible to place deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond	489.87
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two	524.57
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced conversation which almost always ended by the traveler abandoning his purse to save his	256.01
so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos am widower and have forty thousand francs	534.92
but you will see him then think not	75.33

while watched the window he guarded the	155.19
alas said morrel with feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed	324.56
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little	836.64
besides artagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy	457.62
adieu monsieur de rochefort he	49.71

my son he exclaimed suddenly where is my son edward edward and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward the name was pronounced in such tone of anguish that the servants ran	261.68
when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away tear when villefort trembling and crouched in corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that may at least know who killed my	400.54

the guards were under arms and artagnan took his place in the midst of his	62.54

all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for minute but quick as bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest	216.34
there to his great astonishment artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry	406.52
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all can say is so much the worse for those who are	110.53

why diamonds and she is covered with	243.09
think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own	137.96
cavalcanti trust you will not leave before have had the honor of presenting you to some of my	101.09

danglars returned at this moment	83.24
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de	131.31
did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back	206.73
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of	338.22
but all know sir is that am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the	228.78
the cardinal reached second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of	326.10

but as this dream cannot be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens	538.58
mordaunt stopped	3134.22
noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is violent	533.94
what these happy persons took for reality was but dream but it was dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without murmur believing that the death they underwent was but quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them slight	602.46
ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his	352.52
he took her for the queen said	56.43
but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your	1520.91
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so	348.94
but my wife wants gold chain and want pair of silver	2011.01
then listen to	40.98
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the	255.11
not the least in the world replied	71.15

the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were	366.32
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which damp vapor was rising young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen	285.51
you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with	178.69

my faith said	33.69
in this place were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of money in gold and the barrels were filled with pounds of	591.72
it was only way of	119.97
when do you wish the carriage to be here in an	39.34
it was	959.98
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the	516.77
you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either friend who rocks us gently as nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the	729.28
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing	183.84
yes let us go to the library	130.94
how could then return to brussels should injure the queen instead of serving	289.79
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted which compels us here to give public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under government but moderately indulgent to men of	1303.47
hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various	272.43
there followed between these two personages strange silence during which the sound of slow and regular step was heard	542.38
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening	712.17
upon your honor upon my	121.85
if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said monte	84.33
of what companion are you speaking dear constance of her whose carriage was at the gate of woman who calls herself your friend of woman to whom you have told	188.38
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same	599.71
and now said la ramee must ask your highness pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his	108.83
do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which could be arrested is still unknown to your	104.87
the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over vase of roses as if to inhale their	479.39
the cardinal has tenacious memory and long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill	486.85
in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	159.08
did not tell you wished for one replied the count	96.04
said villefort fetch the	542.08
yes but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that	157.62
well cried artagnan tell us all about	131.43
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax	1104.89
but you come from	118.63
yes you know you	39.14
ah what beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that could talk to him and pat him he is as you see very valuable animal said	194.64
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our	281.26
only their wish to see each other had become necessity and they would have preferred death to day	325.14
fortune is courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back	1389.94
they arrived at the drinking room of the	126.37
already rich he held high official situation though only twenty	2501.40
morrel in corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his	410.39
athos standing looked at them both with indescribable	446.21
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has	66.02
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long	224.75
there was no one in the whole group in bad humor except cardinal	311.83
for thousand pistoles for thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar not one too	740.23
well read the letter	230.86
de montbazon and	1246.72
what is that said the	28.31
artagnan went last still shaking his	402.20
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countess suspicions were destitute alike of sense and	669.12
but even this would have availed little against more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too	745.05
that it said the cardinal that	30.62
yes said artagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you can think that artagnan artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the	145.31
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than	585.82
he had given his word not to watch	173.23
la chesnaye louis	15060.41
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen	208.53
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king	137.46
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as bas	919.46
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at	185.70
he is beforehand with us	115.88
one day he was surprised in lonely road between huguenot and catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on	390.42
she was	100.83
and you obeyed father that woman was	607.37
welcome to	2230.55
come come said artagnan more reason why we should start on our	208.50
on reflection my dear du vallon it is great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to	80.08
with regard to artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master	164.33
my word said de winter rising think the hussy is going mad come come calm yourself madame puritan or ll remove you to	641.88
the or are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own alight and secondly how to extinguish the of	769.43
no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur herblay and myself to madame	364.11
man advanced to the door with kind of scythe in his	70.51
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how paragraph in newspaper may exasperate	263.37
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is most singular	125.75
yes but we will talk of	63.22
thought you did must have been	77.27
oh reverend sir since you left toulon what have you lived on answer me on what could	421.42
nothing but saddles now do you understand said	165.95
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these	487.82
épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person believe	195.34
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing	187.81
milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before	135.81
well then how am free person to whom can refuse nothing has come to demand	230.85
listen then lord	525.40
and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy	299.11
you wish to see me and you come to	40.94
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their	483.37
in france chapter	4398.32
oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable anti	260.62
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating step or two as if to keep on his	236.69
yes you will much oblige	355.37
am ready my son said	172.48
ah very well that an explanation said	177.54
the cart was returning empty to paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoner thirst along the	460.21
but cried morrel groaning with sorrow love her you love whom cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards	316.34
yes true as gospel said artagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine	601.88
do you remember how he cried on artagnan on am taken and when he had discharged his two pistols what terrible noise he made with his sword one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were	282.76
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to labor which if successful would conduct you to precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such scheme resigning himself rather to	443.83
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with bursting heart returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for	172.21
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap little	294.02
good lord try one throw one throw is soon made and if lose you will	1101.92
tis artagnan sword he	345.46
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we	271.05
doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was	375.04
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in	410.39
hang it cried artagnan another twenty pistoles	417.63
didn you see that monsieur artagnan mounted with difficulty it will be even more difficult to	139.39
if by any good luck you lay your hand on certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into corner and to wring his	402.99
when he reached the door stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening	214.02
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though all francs are worth regretting but am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second	266.01
and you have succeeded exclaimed	406.37
de villefort	199.09
must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune	1103.83
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take ride with me to	281.58
then said he write to	134.01
foi_ there is no	118.05
that nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her	101.26
you well know my lord that there always remains to us last	300.01
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and run no risk besides should any ill luck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be	306.37
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to	80.04
have always observed that they bandage people eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the and really have nothing to complain of for what see makes me think of the wonders of the	477.05
monte cristo looked inquiringly at his	152.43
they had not seen him for two	35.99
he spoke in voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the	220.74
the boat followed in the wake of the ship speck near the enormous	390.44
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had	179.29
from distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of jeune amélie_ and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late	629.10
albert opened the letter with fear uttered shriek on reading the first line and seized the	285.93
well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the	143.73
then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she	258.70
you could do no such thing fernand you are soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain fisherman and contented with my friendship as cannot give you	180.36
do not be in such hurry to do that said valentine with sad	84.02
heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his	286.89
listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father misfortunes to	242.58
on the staircase they met beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the	450.28

but it seems to me said monte cristo and must begin by asking your pardon for what am about to say that	51.93
the baron entered slowly sending scrutinizing glance from milady to the young	566.07
really impossible yes that is great word	166.34
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so	246.53
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over	618.02
full dress said the major half	423.94
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the	66.31
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second	78.36
that monsieur artagnan is very brave man mother said the young	89.82
all four once more	1545.83
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his	332.13
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine clock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence	91.14
until this day and for how long time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of	151.94
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the	263.46
why do you doubt it because the secret does not belong to him because as have told you it has to do with great	79.13
it is my mother who dissents she has clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed	479.05
dantès seemed full of	534.28
regret did not inform you sooner of this	183.05
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather am to go with	39.46
send your saddle then to the hôtel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with	94.86
at the end of an instant observation he heard the noise of vehicle and saw milady carriage stop opposite to	147.25
nonsense he had us in his power and he let us	81.62
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely	750.12
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing	559.01
be prudent in any event said the	167.54
clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château if seemed like the phantom of mortal	644.08
the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his	350.11
should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very	59.18
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has	77.11
suddenly from an apoplectic	2922.30
he then looked at the objects near	86.75
she held in her hand fresh billet from	339.11
in vain were an ambitious man should struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that am not ambitious am going to prove to	207.88
am brutal not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial	233.49
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to	278.18
have not tried to discover her other	235.86
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir cannot understand your generosity oh it is very simple my good fellow have been sailor and your story touched me more than it would	158.07
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his	261.47
to yours	949.94
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud shoulders the end of cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to	258.86
it is five hundred feet from here in advance said	121.14
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the	64.88
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the	243.58
for the rest this vengeance was very easy for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber	232.16
provoked by complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall send valentine to you the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his	499.56
is this corpse come to life already felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for novice and that the first act was being performed of comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments thought so my lord said felton but as the prisoner is woman all wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to woman if not on her account at least on my	205.94

man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but	231.18
all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to	107.40
then run to the door and open it	151.03
being no disciple of cagliostro was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see	401.37
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband father yes	206.75
how foolish you are have you forgotten	179.80
all have forgiven me some have even loved me but think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night see that woman ghost rising before	339.08

porthos could hardly keep his	550.31
and renew my	2260.14
one moment yes answered the	100.27
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment friend father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother would rather die hundred times oh yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine alone can save you and	274.40

rue du	3933.02
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such real ear clipper did porthos	1375.00
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the	254.57
shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and will therefore	202.58
danglars has only been secondary agent in this sad affair and it is	234.63
he was soon ordered to the presence of the	36.74

you are right said the	33.71
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon couch rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on blue velvet doublet embroidered with	655.38

morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and will do so be satisfied when you spoke to me at the cemetery answered you my heart was softened when you arrived here allowed you to	177.27
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to	285.96
how can we be implicated in any way all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting	289.74
madame replied villefort with mournful smile have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment firm and zealous friend to religion and order better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while have no other impulse than warm decided preference and	436.97
my friend monsieur du vallon is of very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all	185.53
there is another method said	123.65
confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued	178.77
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her	317.22
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his	141.89
coquenard did not seem to observe	57.97
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo	69.51
danglars says you are rich and perfectly	249.61
de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it	398.99
oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth	1303.81
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was	233.96
well that what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by	275.65
cloud opposite estrées pavilion artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could	641.33
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by ladder of	347.97
will the marquis honor me by few moments private conversation ah it is really serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort	739.91
all this showed artagnan that there was veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this	251.08
well be assured added he with the familiarity of gascon you shall not wait	225.87
ah it all one said the host have lost two customers but this one remains of whom am pretty certain for some days to	194.17

do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived	172.84

what is it	58.34
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life	148.58
and who is the man do not	33.08
impossible said madame de	8.87

richelieu as everyone knows had loved the	304.33
you understand no more	403.06

milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in	316.64
noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the	182.87

you are right aramis let us travel	101.01

oh monsieur monsieur you will kill yourself cried	106.11
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with carriage drawn by two powerful	282.64
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his	377.82
the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow will set	216.01

ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or	608.27
mazarin came within three steps of artagnan and pushed spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its	365.28
duc harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but told him they wouldn look for us where we	485.52

well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg	109.71

and you said athos you forget that you committed very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter	241.89
back shouted artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in moment they were upon them third pistol shot was heard aimed by artagnan and one of his adversaries	475.70
you mean that this demands explanation do you not admit	329.73
this beverage required good half hour to	1585.16
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with matter which only concerned	201.45

attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this	139.40
ah my time is not valuable replied the man with melancholy	110.35
are you not going to put up at the arms of england yes	34.81
danglars hidden behind curtain watched the departure he had been waiting	368.75
then tis something	1048.12
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be	126.49
last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested	141.72
they arrived without accident at the rue des	292.75
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo what do think said albert evidently surprised at such question from his companion think he is delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent	372.59
ah capital said	346.08
who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte	88.96
ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding	127.23
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous	1851.54
you see madame how rightly spoke when said required preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings	970.51
athos was about to	49.93
the horse said morcerf	382.40

then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had	366.43
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte	180.81
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend fat back now sir allow me to leave you for could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded	186.05
the king has nothing like	148.03
however he added turning to porthos should not regret dying sir were sure that by doing so might still be useful to	246.81
thank you thank you murmured	72.37
it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	171.46
capital yes understand everyone would like	1218.30
this good major cavalcanti is come to take second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to	152.36
does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly	332.26
mousqueton collected store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the	707.21
artagnan seemed	11842.50
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead go sir count replied artagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you little longer in england well for my part bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to scaffold in order to have better view of the king execution	213.34
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend	213.01
carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to	906.76
what are you about asked	50.34
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the	164.27
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the	45.82
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage joy that under any other circumstances	432.58
then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are	162.87
passing alongside one of them artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom artagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than glimpse of	200.44
they will not dare to refuse me then and will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an	52.79
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key open the	219.94
the story begins	1574.91
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and	156.49
and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for saw it	1333.15
alas said andrea sighing one cannot be completely happy in this world	186.36
you are right said du	252.24
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw	410.84
what said	28.12
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well	166.67
as the last stroke died away saw faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just	283.06
you have promised me to go said the	24.09
be more	6729.76
then was ready to dismount but it was too late descended into the arms of the	105.73
the little light in the lodge had long been	451.17
this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young	55.29
this mystery required an explanation at least so artagnan declared to	501.02
the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and	1239.51
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me entered as have now done and substituted in the place of the poison healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your	546.81
as to the man to be depended upon have him under my hand monsieur	172.42
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that	643.52
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve	292.60
moment said athos with your permission monsieur wish to speak word with my	79.29
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together	487.71
said danglars have always intended giving my daughter francs as her dowry she is besides my sole	863.85
for what for	237.12
your brother in law is barrister doctor he was merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor	281.31
but now hasten on board will join you there ere	754.62
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him think yes well	191.45
that is quite my	223.92
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons	301.88
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as rush the poor lad strength was almost	273.06
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by artagnan circumstance which appeared to furnish happy augury for the success of his	265.86
that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at	122.18
often ask pardon of god swear to you because this action the only one with which have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject	203.92
what say you morrel foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about	218.92
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true	172.18
pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from bundle of papers letter and showing it to the count he said find here letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de	280.71
beauchamp left the box perfectly	1683.59
here is letter have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this	202.13
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them	102.50
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little	317.38
rest assured cried the duchess shall do what	202.12
new source of noise and movement was added to the	281.68
thus all may go well all may be for the best but we do not go far from this place seven or eight leagues at the	116.27
that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear	595.41
grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the	107.48
come now said athos you are	83.93
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was caderousse reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan can you make up your mind fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted	357.70
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour could join her did not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles what can do what story can invent under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing good	541.21
to be sure to be sure cried dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous	399.89
at these words there was murmur along the benches and second voice not that of woman but man stout and furious thundered behind	573.92
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome	440.48
avast there all hands take in the studding sails and stow the flying	1996.52
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards oh no of course	343.12
it is not here he	32.42
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood	7183.32
the work of revolt continued the whole night	458.68
in france sire at small port near antibes in the gulf of	1281.97
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf	273.22
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but man royalty is the gift of	264.21
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	553.81
there are ten men to accompany	98.38
and moreover in taking such step we should appear to be doubtful of	388.02
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the	279.23
the latter to make short cut had appeared on	1127.53
and then feel the loss of my house tis long time since visited my	418.13
every blow was accompanied with terrible	655.51
but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one	104.16
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst tighten my horse girth and come back and tell me if there is light in any of the jesuits	338.64
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	363.82
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of	350.82
till we meet again then dear traitor till we meet again my forgetful charmer tomorrow my angel tomorrow flame of my life chapter	1569.15
probably said	22.95
bonacieux dead and to artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to	209.77
oh am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak beg of	111.91
as to his going or staying feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to	168.54
and now you will do me favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn	84.81
great age you mean monsieur	233.94

will make verses said	292.32
ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy	223.95
five minutes later he came down the grand	176.58
in what branch in the	580.52
have seen	802.83
milady mounted upon chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	159.64
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of ball for he is doubtless musketeer	224.51
however there are plenty in the world but you don look in the right direction for them my	105.20
but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make friend about cromwell	126.76
and was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with certain degree of	264.34
you would have done what	55.12
the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and will not	363.41

de villefort house and long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la	320.00
shall not	31.60
and the two carriages passed on towards their different	626.20
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the	426.24
do you aramis order the	753.80
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of	162.17
wait said	17.00
if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become	104.63
not step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or will hamstring your	185.11
used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and have done all that he did except breaking cord by the corrugation of my	470.23
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	332.04
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just	74.72
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one self not in paris but in	162.20
and feeling in his pocket he took thence small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of	654.63
the jewel is yours my dear athos did you not tell me it was family jewel yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	191.01
villefort was about to retire	52.04
you at marseilles yes says	672.11
it is long since we have had good dinner and for my part have somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry confess to fortify myself with few glasses of good old	290.77
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping louis into his	125.85
and shall we go and find him inquired	164.61
yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the	51.23
no said porthos expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not	105.93
then he descended smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the	268.80
here it is answered the	51.48
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount	206.78
never mind be silent will	1162.18
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more	219.41
get in	1091.10
it was of koller building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred	381.54
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue	200.18
intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and half if you do not hear of us take possession of	143.42
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune but he has wealth believe	292.21
well blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for moment from the voluminous scholiast before	432.30
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient	515.20
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by	1933.63
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeed very probable thing by the by in gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper	791.54
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied artagnan	452.21
artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him	149.55
but artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with long plume of scarlet	596.13
he visited his own	683.59
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where frightful spectacle awaited	278.24
the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the	148.85
oho said porthos his eyes glistening at the	170.72
never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two	620.57
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in moment they both fell back the host uttering cry of horror and grimaud becoming	357.24
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like	275.45
the two friends made an appointment for ten clock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter	116.54
we should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said	110.80
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his	295.77
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of	235.55
and what is your opinion ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal	126.89
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and	179.26
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate	231.60
dare say you know how to navigate should he fail	526.47
yes replied	231.15
what cried athos are you selling my horse my bajazet and pray upon what shall make my campaign upon grimaud have brought you another said	313.04
he is worse than that he is devil returned the	131.75

at length he found himself at the foot of staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six	107.83
the blaze illumined the sea for hundred paces	925.38
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they	510.65
be civil or shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one	1205.45
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to	84.76

on what was artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling he was thinking of	295.41

the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	103.57
from the abbé busoni	114.53
what do you mean only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same	134.37
athos foreseeing the period when he should make soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous	643.50
artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into	197.21

it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly	459.45
the idea was not that of christian knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my	677.04
what you are ignorant of lord de winter designs upon me	72.77

carlini teeth clenched	45374.11
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this	115.65
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so	212.49
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each	381.59
he came up with her before she had traversed third of the	175.23
buckingham dead or desperately wounded as left without having been able to hear anything of	315.29

the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the	179.13
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with great sword wound through his body it was supposed that had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for	230.65
they continued to admire it but said no more about it and with rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another	352.82
are you not rich yourself my father income is about francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when	278.50
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been	133.45
anyone but man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward extraordinary repugnance for the count projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little	442.39
yes giulio she said proud and happy for have found the means of strangling this	581.17
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred	554.32
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such numerous and promising	246.73
the note is	1302.17
and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and	107.68

the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like wild beast in its	847.10
did you see the president at the minister last night	107.08
at the sound of that carriage shuddered soon heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don	262.16
the count went out first then	172.00
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the	238.93
it was said sailor of frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were	353.67
sir he said can tell you what is at present unknown to her	72.57
at the same moment well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel want to speak to the	235.12
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to	168.32
drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs eau est bien prouvé par le	874.06
to answer you would be to forget	72.13
poor fernand has been dismissed continued	770.22
there was kind of solemnity in this	262.61
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to	309.58
the history of athos imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the	161.58
ah you resist do you cried	610.95
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with sad though affable	173.60
my king said aramis they well may raise scaffold but they cannot make an	308.15
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited	273.63
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very	373.71
what is it you want said the	36.52
know it to avoid meeting him my mother and left	314.72
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important	359.76
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote	462.10
the study does not take long it was acting as supernumerary that was so	500.24
and as to my other instructions asked the fair	654.47
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	145.90
olivain said athos showing the servant raoul shoulder belt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too	955.81
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over large table was tracing on map the route from	272.38
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been friend or the master of the	117.75
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept small inn on the route from bellegarde to	329.59
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy	568.93
and was he not so asked the	73.29
continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not it	235.47
which route must take demanded artagnan in his	308.42
monte cristo made sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio	114.88
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was	129.63
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete	349.10
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted	555.00
it is quite wonderful	808.75
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from	284.41
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale	988.87
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that saved your life that is strange for it is week	90.66
gentlemen said the king to those around him leave you to brave the tempest go before you to kingdom which knows no	321.14
he too ten years ago had piously sought out tomb and sought it	2032.06
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to	352.83
and at the same minute carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before	276.23
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that have found that which sought like patient miner have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil	2248.12
very well monsieur said	54.07
it was mercédès leaning on her son arm and leaving the	145.66
that was the general opinion sir said the major and yes replied the count and you confirmed the	108.73
from whom asked the	129.82
nothing was	333.81
yes replied artagnan am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses	313.12

dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel	86.16
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as	200.14
artagnan approached quickly making sign to his two companions to remain few steps	236.92
cannot replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the	94.81
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine why you have drunk more than hundred pistoles worth am ruined man lost destroyed bah said athos we were always	720.62
monseigneur your eminence is hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary think have not proved myself worthy of your	146.54
in this apartment continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night	1905.82
surgeon reverend sir surgeon said	983.71
adieu my friend adieu on the contrary said the count this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in week we shall have left france behind	70.48
one day the young shepherd told the count steward that he had seen wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his	416.01
ask for no	111.54
hum said the host in doubtful	90.76
porthos instead of returning directly home artagnan alighted at the door	197.73
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected	255.05
if you are determined said athos do	71.00
are you looking for anything	514.27
see answered the	173.18
and monsieur leaves me here alone you are afraid planchet no only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that lackey who has the rheumatism makes but poor servant particularly to master as active as	411.74
madame faltered artagnan tis twenty years ago have good memory since had the honor behind piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely	449.75
this point settled the duke turned to	410.87
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for am very	327.73
may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of artagnan had not entirely	147.42
one man alone remained in his place gun in	237.51
farther on still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of	486.94
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	183.45
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the	227.02
the judge	1793.61
what are you going to do asked the wounded	26.97
ah that all very fine retorted the	542.38
be satisfied replied felton he will not	189.45
ah indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts	303.51
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles th february delivery	548.41
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of	574.86
it was mixed mass of blue red and	340.50
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint	270.92
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have sword by your side have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve	129.63
was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the	171.51
villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered swear to you by all hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall	376.35
and you did not know that it was inhabited by young man	49.37
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish	104.85
in that case let there be no more question of what past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	209.26
true monsieur le comte replied artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over	348.21
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the	755.66
porthos nodded in sign of	1703.01
no it was somewhere away from here it was do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with lovely sky and some religious mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing beautiful peacock in garden and you madame were under the trellis of some	444.88
from time to time shot from musket or the blade of rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts	413.99
impossible it would be dishonor to all the	144.97
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom have given three sword wounds next milady whose secret have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance have	1035.10
oh mercédès have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my	368.71
transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with	422.02
the cavalier made movement as if to follow the carriage but artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped	267.19
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at little hamlet too poor to pay priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by	199.77
slight color mounted to his	459.44
but artagnan was still in desponding	840.85
andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as small square added to the rectangle of the	267.91
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the	181.57
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by similar one conducting to another	231.78
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	141.10
what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense pray do not call what consider the wisest action of my life by such	746.12
has your uneasiness anything to do with	154.73
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is fernand whom you see here is good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with very fine girl named mercédès but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the and as the arrived today why you understand no do not understand said	177.32
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the	133.86
what is that tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my	156.24
so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private	147.77
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to	294.22
what my horse your horse seven against eight point short you know the	835.88
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing	103.78
there were three candles alight each of which burnt before window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and third upon the rue saint	366.29
cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably	114.61
that correct said the	134.17
have you ever seen him	222.33
an admirable subject cried the	914.98
this was blow to	169.60
but pardon said artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in	241.95
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such	731.50
do not reject it altogether said athos but wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be	221.44
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his	115.33
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in	157.36
have you forgotten anything said	67.38
we are alone sir said buckingham speak my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to young woman named charlotte	229.95
de tréville	261.40
the young men filled up their third of glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do	253.03
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the	303.22
the execution cried	523.93
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de	370.44
yes yes that is	39.36
no that is sufficient man can pass through	248.08
no wounded his horse	1171.04
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still nose but his cheeks fattened out each took portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his	431.26
the minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be	326.36
monsieur the coadjutor carriage she exclaimed falling	945.36
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like mask the whole	315.03
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised	133.68
but your release can be	409.09
no madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your	212.12
was the woman handsome young and	413.41
look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood colored drapery and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen villefort became livid madame danglars fell into long seat placed near the	643.12
you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to poison administered to young girl ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my	377.97
at this last thought mercédès burst into flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to	248.59
will prevent	194.25
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether can be of further service to	143.26
will go and take turn in the garden to recover	129.70
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	237.82
two methods of self destruction were at his	894.52
