artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her	49.43
my lord said artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious	23.42
de villefort started from his seat then in moment fell down again silent and	25.37

let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it	85.11
mordaunt mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed	12.60
what is this said aramis to	29.12
what is offered from generous heart should be accepted	24.44
yes but have my breviary to repeat answered aramis then some verses to compose which madame aiguillon begged of	71.00

gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody professions of	107.22

they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to armentières each by different	23.94
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his	33.23

speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the	47.03
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of	36.71

now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at little door and thanking artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made sign to guitant to follow	92.05

it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to	76.89
monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and	23.78

athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady forehead and then in voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul will blow your brains	101.44

the young man with the intuitive perception of lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was	35.27
man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of	52.49

the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own	21.03
on his side artagnan became more cautious	18.14

what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the	13.08
he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn	22.71
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire fire then when the shot was	57.11
don think the sides are	15.84
artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived	11.24

short or tall about your own height	30.72
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar	69.21
what does this mean monsieur cardinal asked the king in severe	18.93
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed	11.17
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which could not rouse	30.90

what are you doing on the watch what aramis here cried	14.98

bazin quickly covered the table with damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that artagnan was quite	44.61
well well said one the madman has gone to look his	22.94

one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he	93.43

danglars and you	335.29
the duke meant to say	8.60
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented	40.68
tis long time since saw thee come come artagnan said athos do not affect to be strong minded there are tears in your	48.30
but am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat	26.89
ideas and men appeared the same to him said	16.94
and the wife of king charles wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us such is the hospitality shown to queen by the minister from whom king demands	57.77
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for	16.36
the countenance of old dantès	20.19
villefort immediately despatched	4.73
but sir once more beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that am detaining	30.97
man of spirit is not to be reminded of such	22.45
but alas have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in word and repeat it because it expresses all wish to convey we will	256.59
behind the penitents came man of vast stature and	15.91
it was that of man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was commander and on the right breast the star of grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles	49.14
artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the	18.37
faith that would be far better life than lead now but monsieur mazarin is mean wretch who won dispossess himself of his diamond in my	66.26
zounds what flavor cried artagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your	29.61
therefore when at dessert upon sign from artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns why replied porthos mouston of	71.51
well we must try to take him	18.26
morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond will let you know that directly have	48.90
ah replied the duke here think is one of my servants who is seeking	16.83
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared	31.33
the devil he is said	6.44
and no steel traps	4.84
cama the pilot of the ferdinand_ went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy	53.14
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much	59.69
no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize am sure of	47.68
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with	29.59
but drink some of this and the count took bottle from his pocket containing red liquid of which he poured few drops into the	46.70
you believe so	51.13
then make yourself quite	7.46
we will explain in few words how artagnan had been led to choose that place of	37.20
does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry	14.17
he should have been nothing said the king	7.24
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all	15.61
what does he mean asked	13.45
fairfax answered laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of woman is not such fool as to be	33.15
was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find	54.63
yes the gascon answered athos you who are perfect being bid spirit triumph over	21.33
if strike with the sword or discharge the contents of pistol at man with whom for three years have been on terms of intimacy must at least know why do so must meet him with heart at ease and that quiet conscience which man needs when his own arm must save his	85.10
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in mortuary	16.70
yes yes said felton doubted but now	23.89
will go myself and fetch the	10.98
ah my dear sir you will see whether cavalcanti is to be treated like common person and andrea gliding through the court like black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in	77.39
good replied aramis	46.21
what do you mean have you seen him lately he sent for me to	27.99
and am very glad you recognize me	23.41
do you wish for time to pay delay would save my honor and consequently my	28.87
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can	89.42
that is very	20.83
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy	42.43
fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without	59.47
and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy where is the child villefort shrugged his	42.66
athos cast cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near	29.60
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear	28.39
understand now why they murdered	29.25
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to	15.61
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of	46.64
really don know what hotel it is all do know is that observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense exclaimed guitant with burst of laughter those men must be	87.12
jacques de la	15.99
true replied	17.78
be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as veracious	33.59
all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porter lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had	34.12
well and what are you going to do at	24.53
pardieu certainly all four we couldn leave our prisoners could we ah ah said	32.04
the count shuddered at the tones of voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their	34.22
hear said aramis but understand neither the noise nor the cry of	12.38
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends	42.05
five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince	22.95
as the door was closed rochefort cast glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the	29.68
athos began to	53.32
my faith said artagnan it appears that was more drunk than you since remember nothing of the	29.01
that it said artagnan had forgotten that he was only musketeer for	25.66
monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was	34.79
suddenly mousqueton uttered cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered dozen similar bottles bread and monster junk of salted	59.67
humph said the major very	4.01
at this moment soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for	28.03
artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it	15.30
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by majority of his subjects yes madame chatillon stammered	64.86
at this the delight of the mother was almost	9.99
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with	54.66
really my dear monsieur artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles	15.53
and said aramis am alone in the world and have only your majesty to	17.12
or from your generosity my friend to so good marksman as you are may say what would appear absurd to	54.41
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw piece of money into the hat which was on the	21.79
take care repeat to you take	8.50
that it said the	24.78
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of good stick to accelerate his	57.51
but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two	29.25
the ranks closed firmly in and kind of majestic tremor ran from man to	25.54
eh said he showing	19.74
but resumed la ramee that is only way of	19.34
have not said good morning to you monsieur artagnan he said nevertheless have remarked	35.30
nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong	21.24
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not	41.26
but they may come any moment for you left word that awaited them yes	35.35
and you spoke to him why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with	32.38
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual	15.62
because my dear fellow you understand one must never be	29.46
myself and planchet are all that such simple expedition	17.19
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and have brought some weapons which bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on similar	54.95
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under artagnan arm entered and broke mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring	62.35
day came the table had disappeared only had still the knife in my	13.56
and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her	9.83
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the	18.99
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his	21.07
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop	17.61
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this woman	48.75
yesterday took the place of	14.60
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal guards who recognized artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with smile of singular	68.77
albert turned away his head with sigh and went to his own	22.89
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the	23.13
she was said to have weak chest and like antonia in the violin_ she would die one day while	44.07
told you on the contrary take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two	11.18
de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her	14.26
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid	40.13
mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the	33.17
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what louis	60.91
mercédès raised herself on her feverish	14.60
here replied the	140.09
monsieur du tremblay received artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to	40.89
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped	72.86
you see someone pays me	11.11
to me to you and which discovered in the pocket book of the	15.05
she is ill great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared prey to the most horrible	98.58
alas murmured edmond to himself this is terrible relapse there was only this blow	29.79
have pity on me doctor so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that am on the verge of	36.19
there he said is our	16.01
the road was long but the horses upon which artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of	49.42
planchet said artagnan cocking his pistols will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one	27.06
you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards	34.49
artagnan looked much	25.75
artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following	46.80
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his	57.31
am tolerable chemist and prepare my pills	34.90
and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la	28.19
upon my word you would make caesar	32.25
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their	21.27
what is his name for of course you know the count of monte	16.52
no misfortune has happened to the queen cried buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the	40.05
the man fell like an ox beneath the	10.96
don let us disarrange your	14.01
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles yes and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the	27.17
bills upon his majesty private treasury answered artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of	58.92
back already what can have happened then to bragelonne let him enter cried artagnan let him come	37.22
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his	21.84
oh don doubt	16.81
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of	19.77
friend he cried feel that am dying thanks he made last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside	46.08
is that she mamma asked eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair yes said madame danglars that is	50.55
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already prey to the	34.12
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange	55.77
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered to morrow we shall know if you are good in	31.99
egad one would think it had been placed here on	19.49
will not attempt to argue with you but blame	19.66
eh no do not surrender egad on the contrary be off and	16.50
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on	60.14
when he was only few paces from me saw that what had taken for weapon was only	25.01
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the	6.35
for my part observed aramis cannot say the same as you do	19.08
in that case must say adieu to you as am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday	54.98
you are discreet so much the	8.75
have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all	28.81
you approve of him he is one of the most well bred young men	21.84
very good thought artagnan tis our road likewise we will go	46.16
unfold your plan my lord and we will	17.55
write to me at paris	8.10

do you know whom have encountered here	14.27
then have full occupation for am	17.70
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death suddenly about nine clock in the evening edmond heard hollow sound in the wall against which he was	47.16
and if you should hear of anything very scandalous will communicate it to	23.91
monsieur said athos have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which am astonished as it is not at all their	73.82
ah believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carelessly they like to unite their	38.50
hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of father cannot revert upon his	43.11
the time and place are but ill suited for an	21.32
de boville	20.47

ali brought in the	9.60
the road to	27.09
he wished to see	28.88
which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and	11.60
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be	29.38
had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore say what does that signify to me sir well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you	82.58
and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over	27.23
and in that codicil he acknowledges	14.20
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor would have been alive to speak our	59.17
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried	9.04
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow	50.95
the result was that to prevent	8.51
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the	10.32
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governor belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to	63.69
this foraging did not occupy more than half an	24.47
willingly replied de	9.22
will denounce you before men as have denounced you before god and if it be necessary that like lucretia should sign my accusation with my blood will sign	52.41
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux	84.37

although of paleness that was almost livid this man had remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled	89.08
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent	29.61
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and	77.62
ah indeed said avrigny struck with sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him	38.23
porthos bowed to the	14.08
but as you are the strongest all continued artagnan don be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate	53.66
have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his	13.85
sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for will answer for it something lightning like will happen ere to	56.36
by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only public	88.44
so then the wedding is to take place	10.69
should have been pleased to see her for like her very	22.64
the weather was magnificent and the excursion	8.82

alas excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in manner that would have excited the count laughter had not thoughts of superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous	54.38
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the	53.87
am so	303.02
these proceedings made artagnan and porthos draw	17.88
propos_ add one thing what saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent	39.52

fools said charles do they take me for coward like themselves you have done well to warn	34.97
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air anglaise_ and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral	60.82
come artagnan don let us play sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble	106.21
oh is it you dear friends did you come here to fetch me will you take me away with you do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said artagnan to the	47.63
no drowsiness	5.82
at that moment he cut	21.63
know the french as well as if had made them	12.48
meanwhile emmanuel in broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us oh it was cruel to us and dare say it to you	88.91
mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner to you as the king attorney denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your	19.89

artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the	27.33
noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her	28.24
four other noblemen awaited	16.14
for very important notes for which closer attention is required pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own	50.30
and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at	27.35
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father	28.65
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and	12.13
may beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter oh you are no stranger at least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but	72.68

by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to	42.86
mazarin as statesman will understand the politic	25.08
suppose happen to strangle him to be sure there would only be swiss the less in the world but you will not do so	32.74
artagnan pressed nothing but corpse in his	11.82
at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment servant entered the room and whispered few words in his	40.31
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the	21.98
ho ho replied	9.65

an old acquaintance replied	15.99
come said andrea you are man void of compassion ll have you turned	23.61

you had new livery yesterday yes	16.91
the company looked at each other in	8.08

they withdrew to private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an	61.32
planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed	41.22
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited	8.40

de saint méran madame de saint méran barrois all fall would	28.73
de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to	28.98
terrible howling interrupted these reflections of artagnan and	44.81
so far good monseigneur but afterwards when once in the bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in low	26.70
the prince was said to be in person at	12.54
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis	10.57

at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her	37.57
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left space which looked ready to serve as last resting place for the	41.19
and they set out at as hard canter as their horses could	22.90

the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while artagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly can draw back but at least if am killed shall be killed by	65.51

the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated	31.79
he had not done so for ten years	29.18
nearly ten minutes passed heard no other noise but the beating of my own	31.42

he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather	25.40
the comte de rochefort bowed like man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and	20.44
artagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like soldier under	37.05
and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any	11.02
it is singular said artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one must have known but who it was cannot yet	40.00

madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so	35.47
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public	15.29

as they stopped at the door of the cardinal study artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his	34.40
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim fiery	46.01
such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret	52.67
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the	100.43

he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not	39.64
artagnan took pen and wrote madame until the present moment could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did feel myself of such an honor besides was so seriously indisposed that could not in any case have replied to	89.99
teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice	19.83
and now you are assembled gentlemen said artagnan permit me to offer you my	32.38
then piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of	25.41
you do not belong to the human species you are demon escaped from hell whither we send you back	28.60
the fragments of the jug broke and an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his	31.14
porthos and will stay	16.85
the jeweller	37.07
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her	34.01
as shall ever receive the defense of great principle my dear	20.22
because sigh when thinking of someone am leaving come morrel it is not like soldier to be so bad judge of	45.43

if should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be another turn and so on provided single one arrives that is all that is	38.96
artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable	39.63
come have habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and	32.26
come replied the same lofty tone answer are you waiting for him underneath these windows did you come to noisy to defend him am waiting for no one replied artagnan who was beginning to be	53.92

what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky	82.27
villefort had only just given utterance to few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter all the disclosures which were made this	71.86
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at	24.24
aramis received ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the	44.09

may as well blow my brains out and all will be	20.30
then he added in low tone yes that is the	29.86
formerly said the count was	4.31
it is very ingenious said the	8.36
artagnan summoned anne of austria servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen	29.45
madame de villefort closed the door carefully the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated	43.42
artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the	21.41
in the first place said he wish my lackey placed with me fully	24.57
moment caderousse face appeared at the grating in the	14.49
from that lucky moment scarron led happy life spending both income and	44.75
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated	71.63
yes but it is not horse for hard	17.58
do you not form very rash judgment emmanuel said	16.52
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the	20.27

it is fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when explained to him who the cavalcanti	42.95
the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden	83.90

well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another	84.61
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised	13.58
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by lamp which threw its light over all that part of the	48.01

the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the	105.85
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that cried artagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding	35.71
he promised to be here and have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be very good	31.10
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us	33.61
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of walk or as place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the	71.97

he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via	27.56
left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to	13.13
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service costume somewhat between military and civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be	76.36
that pity said athos	17.79
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this	32.97
but what the devil you are not priest you are musketeer musketeer for time my friend as the cardinal says musketeer against my will but churchman at heart believe	31.54

in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of	27.16
how is that you told me yourself that that ring that ring have the comte de wardes of thursday and the artagnan of today are the same	29.49
you speak	440.71
how can if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she	41.98
gascon match for cupid chapter	20.15
you would do so said artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of	25.37
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without	34.13
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished	21.46
can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to	30.97
artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own	19.34
de tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him	34.86
the magistrate had slept for short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in	60.76
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert account ceased	64.67

and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in low	38.53
as artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends he held out his hand to the wounded man and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his	47.93

mazarin pretended to	11.66
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw	26.19
athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble	20.27
he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at time according to his valet de	62.20
artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without	21.64
ah said artagnan know what you	13.36

yes but it was fated that should not keep	15.25
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not sublime it was at least curious	38.73
is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked	28.55
we have quitted	18.08
he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their	106.53

you must require such user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg	39.97
ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured	30.25
but he will never have the	17.88
why what can be the use of mixing woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to have told you my dear count that would not for one moment admit of such	82.77
they will not be strangers they will be	15.68
his eminence is not his holiness	10.20
so much the better for him he will suffer less said the	17.47
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the	27.19
before god and before men said he accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of	20.95
she would have taken artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce	37.73
danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but shadow before which the bandits	30.16
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another	41.19
you look at me and you are going to laugh at	14.43

the victory was complete twice he had overcome his	12.89
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his	27.09

woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much have my own opinion as to that	33.89
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the	68.58
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the	34.49
why should obtain you by violence if our love is mutual is it from mere humanity you bid me live would then rather	54.18
no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man society no prefer listening to you here my	36.47
the truth is replied dantès that am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as	93.89
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the	18.15
and the king has seen the cardinal	7.28
poor man he is worthy	10.75
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have real	49.58

he awaits the answer	9.12
no louise no this evening adventure will serve for my	28.30
he found the duke reclining upon sofa with his hand pressed upon the	11.59
own was seeking	22.20
dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes but as we know artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own	72.40
but what do you require of me then let us	20.43
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave	38.44
by no means said	16.85
now at the moment when left his house here aramis	17.17
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved	22.64
now jump down	8.01
and how did this despatch reach you inquired the	17.83
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did not guess truly is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied artagnan and as proof there is crown to drink my	131.43
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished understand said he	39.36
raoul blushed	4.15
but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe	56.98
bah you are	4.76
what cannot tell something wonderful an absurdity miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call	61.81
it was tolerably fine winter day and ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her	59.97
sir said he to danglars understand that do not take final leave of you must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte	57.25
no and yet your father man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the	61.90
yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the	35.34
light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second	21.85
at this moment an officer with pleasant face opened door continued to exchange some words with person in the next chamber and then came up to the	46.50
when one is eating ideas flow	21.73
no and yet they refused to buy	15.00
aramis saluted then turning toward athos don care to camp on the place royale with all these people he	31.90
hope the accident has been of no consequence they don yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been	34.44
but am to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked	33.77
artagnan leaned against the hedge having cast glance behind	13.17
in fact artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his	31.79
wait then said the duke fumbling in his	13.88
if have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity	56.01
not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his	28.16
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes	30.57
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from	22.87
morrel said he in low voice you send us away you are then angry with us no no	27.01
cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose	28.65
impossible for three reasons replied	13.01
when see you merely you look like reasonable being when you speak seem to have to do with	27.54
and what is this cause demanded	18.49
so that since that time replied artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the	23.48

one was young man of three or four and twenty who was in love	23.70
during the darkness as before my supper was	14.01
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his	33.55
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet	26.83
everywhere the last requests of dying man are sacred but with sailor the last requests of his superior are	18.18
beware young man cried	10.30
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for	48.88
well said the doctor moment silence will	19.20
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full	20.64
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the	23.17
my lord said artagnan have an appointment in two hours which cannot	25.66
there was moment	28.20
then continued athos we have another reason it is this listen in france at this moment everything is poor and	41.25
as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with	35.20
come observed the countess smiling see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded	46.35
am priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human	22.23
remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which was obliged to sell we should have remained on the	63.71
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his	30.18
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde little nearer to the former than to the latter small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind sheet of tin covered with grotesque representation of the pont du	68.50
mousqueton will lose another that five and in five minutes we shall have galloped quarter of	29.03
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking folded paper which he held by one	41.24
tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me	45.62
am getting more and more	14.51
so the matter ended for the abbé	5.93
however have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but will endeavor little to illustrate my	60.15
he could not distinguish her countenance but sinister smile passed over the lips of	25.54

by my honor these gascons are incorrigible keep up the dance then since he will have it	35.09
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse	29.47
why because the count is doubtless aware that accompanied you to the meeting this	15.74
yes am the executioner of lille and this is my	11.12
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the	30.14
while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an	41.28

the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with malicious expression that said many	47.38
pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called	17.78
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	46.85
the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the	36.05
make no doubt glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot	35.16
it is mademoiselle louise armilly who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in	28.75

he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis	26.36
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind small ruin where morrel had often	56.54
and was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these	18.46
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing succession and recurrence of the same fancies and	53.59

behind this figure glowed vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax	119.33
oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other	44.01
foi_ captain replied the sentry do not know for the last hour have not heard him	15.14
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white	52.82
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one	25.68
well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their	82.64
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in	30.53
good heavens said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber my dear friend we must take people as we find	59.44
then replied he my visit is ill timed you no doubt stand in need of repose and will	45.75
there artagnan was asleep upon	12.99
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you is it my fortune which you find insufficient is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case only should have been to blame inasmuch as was aware of all these things when made the	82.67

well the poison brings on cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very	217.20
keep guard at the other door athos and	12.79
would take the hundred	7.90

but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie what reason do you assign my reason replied the young	74.99

the first who advances is dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling	59.98

at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such friend and thank god that things are	65.20
with your permission said danglars bowing will precede you to show you the	18.29
it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured	14.76
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish single	46.84
mere masque borrowed from our own	34.72
go sir replied the tutor but in heaven name do not expose yourself to danger do not	18.27
you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight	23.35
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without	9.91
well then hearken to	21.21
porthos however found that he had no straw left for	17.10
villefort cast gloomy look around	19.58
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied	12.17
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life artagnan who had till that day entertained very good opinion of himself felt	95.69
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de	11.25
well then said franz let us to the	14.70
precisely so madame this man was myself for fortnight had been at that hotel during which period had cured my valet de chambre of fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that really acquired reputation as skilful	70.43
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the	42.32

in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen ben sabah and in these gardens isolated	50.80
what are you saying the first prince of the blood the king uncle no not the first prince of the blood not the king uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king uncle repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has new adversary instead of man who threatened man who	73.89
but sit down said monte cristo really do not know what have been thinking of have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an	44.90
the dog turned his back to the	6.47
and then continued	27.52
you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many	40.20
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	21.92
luigi slowly relinquished teresa arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic	68.26
the story first sir said caderousse you must make me	37.53
but under the present circumstances am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the	38.96
artagnan frowned at	8.25
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his	66.88

ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world large fortune covers all	50.54
oh no it is	10.76
and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering	7.15
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier	52.30
tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on	16.05
ah you call yourself oriental levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you	68.35
there said artagnan what did tell you fortunately you won be laid up more than	31.52
de wardes must take his departure still in	22.45
you believed me to be dead did you not as believed you to be and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de	38.30
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound	43.10
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep	31.97
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate	70.31
there is proposition almost like it in the of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the	40.05
oh my god my god you see my strength fails me you see plainly cannot	16.33
well asked he what now is there any difficulty in the way	18.22

athos took his son horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the	23.58

the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and	41.47
let us not lose such an opportunity returned monte	14.83
except that which ask of you dear	40.15
de tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was	23.10
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to distance waves of white	92.10
quick quick	11.05
at this moment the expiring embers threw up fresh flame from the kindling of piece of wood that lay near and bright light flashed over the	36.33
it is you mordaunt he	12.23

besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but asked he in an	44.93
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do and that was what was observing to this gentleman just	42.20
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated you know there are different	34.76
well then can just suit	8.77
what do you want would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca	38.79
they ll kill poor porthos when he comes up said	29.64
those who were acquainted soon formed into little	21.94
then what would happen could not repeat the	16.97
he entered portsmouth about eight clock in the	10.88
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about	21.98
that is it	16.72
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as pair of blacksmith pincers the soldier	28.80
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in state of freedom have evaporated in thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human	57.40
farewell said charles farewell my	13.52
the escort divided into two	21.65
pretended that disliked the idea that house belonging to my wife father and mother should pass into the hands of	32.23
although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently	24.34
moment silence ensued and then in full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable warm drop fell upon his	73.06
your pardon madame know all	17.60
he didn predict the future he knew the past often more dangerous	21.47
if there is third shot said he to himself am lost	26.86
oh my lord said	37.18
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon	40.05
it was sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely	20.77
come gentlemen come the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for	19.97
then shall also	33.01
he is quaker then exactly he is quaker with the exception of the peculiar	13.95
indeed and for that reason did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an	29.23
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got	27.97
the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed	51.26
ah dieu exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for francs well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per	48.81
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be	34.77

all at once he uttered terrible	12.22
another gasconade murmured the	24.47
the devil ah can understand	10.85
de villefort in hoarse voice no it is useless how useless cried the president what do you mean mean that feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes	56.90
come my friend said he	87.51
my lord shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you	33.03
will go will go artagnan took the soldier arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his	26.38
the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four	39.45
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much	52.98
well my dear mouston he said rest	12.11
which you are taking back to him said	15.23
then need not tell you what kind of service he requires of	22.67
asked you continued villefort in perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in	30.72
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach	45.70
then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous tofana_ that they said was lost at	26.94
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder	26.35
instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the	30.38
yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this	72.33
then why did she go just god she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of	22.49
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed	31.54
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur artagnan is	22.58
as well as could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds	20.47
this is woman of twenty six or twenty eight	12.38
may be permitted to inform my wife said	17.76
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his	67.10
certainly you must give the orders for intend residing at the	11.65
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all could to induce you to change your	60.34
artagnan there was musketeer who was in love with one of my	22.21
was he liberated then no he was put in	11.70

oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the and which from the description must probably be the	66.58
monsieur cried the duchess seizing athos hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for monk to come and exorcise	44.02
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like scaffold to	48.55
she listened at eugénie door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in	46.30
this then is what you call devotion congratulate	13.44
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and depend on having he his barony and my promotion on the honor of	31.63
the cardinal writes better than	31.04
believe that alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful	18.02
how is that my friend why thus it is replied	20.62
turned around looked at the trees tried to recall the details which had struck me at the	16.16
he has come then as they told me last	26.92
and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired	17.23
the will	121.50
command you not to stir attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray thought and will send you	35.17
well let us see said mazarin isn there still time to repair the evil search among your friends your oldest	31.91
you know or you don know that that is what we ask of	24.27
the duke meanwhile recovered his self	11.87
till then god preserve your majesty however ill the king might	26.70
man who holds sword in his hand and sees mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is coward why is he not here that may tell him so sir replied monte cristo coldly did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family	94.46
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in sky blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his	97.53
stake your diamond	4.13
where is the man who brought the letter in the	5.70
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his	51.53
de tréville himself	47.16
do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen	69.43
artagnan did the	36.77
what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his	22.38
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite	54.42
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for	19.14
how your majesty is bored have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today fine pleasure indeed monsieur upon my soul everything degenerates and don know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no	54.27
pass your arms around my neck and fear	16.13
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent	16.42
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed	42.77
willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon	22.51
oh yes that is	28.13
it was quite dark and no one saw them go	20.36
at this moment barrois	26.40
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of	75.57
the concierge looked upon the count with	8.44
they seemed awaiting	10.22
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back	60.71
what jealousy to tear such clothes he looks like big bug said another dresses in fine	36.92
this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was	56.21
artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her	23.76
do not	51.04
but think have it said	14.99
we have parted company this long time all three have left the	19.40

it was about four clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the	29.34
the abbé rose took his hat and	7.50
they ask where was born	21.66
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of	60.91
run waiter at this moment the screams and ringing were	18.96
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said	55.97
my faith my dear aramis said artagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	55.55
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was	64.80
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the	39.77
the rendezvous artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no	38.97
and if you wished to die you would choose this death count	22.59
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it second time and saw there was	50.13
my friend said she how came you here alas would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this	51.07
if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his	29.99
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint	24.76
villefort traversed the antechamber cast side glance at dantès and taking packet which gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the	24.96

de salvieux letter embraced renée kissed the marquise hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix	29.98
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	10.69
with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating	15.08
nevertheless it was necessary to	11.47
but and say it with some pride mercédès god needed me and	24.30
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letter donned his dress suit drew on pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to	53.90
speak to you in french said artagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same	20.11
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king	34.44
it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sister in	38.71
what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio	23.45
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such paroxysm of	19.47

being man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal	96.79
recollect our only desire is to carry out in fitting manner the last wishes of our	26.05
planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when	49.77
yes but it is too late said danglars have honored their	27.26
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him guinea each per day and think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite	78.32
yes yes said de guiche strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have	118.02
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for month inhabited small two storied house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only	90.66
then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile tomorrow if you will will hear your narrative but today wish to nurse you	65.75
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of woodcutter and hatchet casting off the lion skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of leaden comb his complexion embrowned with preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy loaf from time to	159.19
morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had	16.42
well must mortify	17.16
and then he was called	29.06
in an instant the horse eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with	23.80
such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with	20.32
it was many years since artagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated	88.50

he may desire to become my heir and	17.74
ah said mazarin breathing more	8.43
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered bunch of muscatel	17.04
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his	18.20
and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his	47.85
to command inferior beings was rather humiliation than pleasure for	22.10
revoir_ benedetto and running into court he	12.00
artagnan remained for moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in closet attached to the queen	98.65
raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter	23.16
mousqueton cried artagnan let us be off let us set	12.14
all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so	24.48
indeed thought porthos casting glance at the three hungry clerks for the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousin place would not keep such gourmands they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six	75.27
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he	69.59
it was not who made that promise cried morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have	31.22
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his	19.79
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the	16.59
should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french	44.18
the day tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day tomorrow he exiles me among the	14.79
you must make some reformation in that	17.97
but artagnan had on the preceding day served his	9.16
whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned	22.76
no you will not forget it because you are man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so	41.24
second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young	21.99
my officer said athos has forgotten to give piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his	45.72
federal laws and your state	15.77
franz and debray exchanged some words in whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in retired path with	44.67
cardinal mazarin as	130.40
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of	75.75
de villefort	63.50
the consequence is that when saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours had recourse to little of my old	84.35
certainly if milady strength had been equal to her hatred	26.22
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count hand and covered it with	32.35
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round	19.55
alas said artagnan it is because am the most	16.24
well said he on perceiving	9.05
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage	15.84
not at all my good	13.16
indeed you give me more credit than deserve only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is	35.34
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had	17.25
bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his	23.89
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten	14.22
if am not mistaken we have to do with	34.83
the jeweller drew from his pocket long flat box which contained several samples of the articles	34.15
at this instant shudder passes over me as reflect that possibly am now standing on the very grave in which	41.17
monsieur said madame de chevreuse believe you are sorcerer am prepared for	28.45
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor	44.24
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced	20.03

cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young	38.44
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but warn you that paris will be burnt down to night upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur artagnan to the end of the	106.93

well really nothing is certain in this	16.83
do not say more relying on you as you may rely on	17.87
but raoul said	16.29

as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full	18.82
madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her son arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the	64.69

noirtier for it was indeed he who entered looked the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first	67.14

for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the	53.04
felton orders were for the rest executed with silent rapidity that gave good idea of the way in which he maintained	32.75
madame bonacieux ah that true said	12.85
artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of	30.55

monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what	20.64
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to	20.07
the same deadly silence succeeded these	13.14
the dying man eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would	27.88
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three artagnans with two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other	64.43
and wherefore aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see resemblance in that young man in beauty or on the contrary asked aramis	56.94

who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his	95.32

but why did it not kill my father told you one evening in the garden madame de saint méran death because his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months have	82.03
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the	26.51
oh my god	53.83
you spoke of	26.54

but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with	68.16
where asked porthos filling second glass of	13.84
artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black	51.24

wait for me here all of you	20.06
oh said he that is life to me more more two drops more would kill you replied the	25.46
but you aramis who were close to him could see nothing but gray beard under the fringe of the	35.78

he had therefore set off at furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint	33.61

the monks had no longer an instant of	20.03
in few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly	90.22
it had been artagnan practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with	99.02
swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course am to pursue	26.25
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze	54.65
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and	53.47
well then asked athos in low	12.28
not the same thing by any	9.30
ah said mazarin to himself what sweet face does she come to borrow money of me and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and	81.52
that may be my lord but since am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and cannot accept your	42.66
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what artagnan was aiming at we ask only for	69.23
but the count did not	10.77
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by beacon just lighted and rock which jutted	24.19
then said the prisoner let think who it can	15.67
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis	64.36
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button	56.62
de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and	28.75
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief ought to be in that shut myself up tell me no truly you comfort	31.85
he looked for his doublet of the year and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its	30.20
planchet who was still little concerned for his safety his recent escapade declared that he would follow artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to	61.22
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own	19.90
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the	38.94

there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfather	35.03
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo	16.55
de villefort cried he am delighted to see	35.06

no one at villefort doubted that duel would ensue from	23.72
both entered and found themselves in darkness but	22.17
artagnan offered his friend part of his share which he should return when	19.34
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the	53.85
the prisoner turned	3.12
on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about	11.19
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also	65.42
poor madame du vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little	47.37
tell him to come to me immediately if he has	19.01
oh when said was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the	44.78
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to	24.51
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all	34.45
ah said the count see	8.02
it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an	68.15
it rests between his conscience and his	12.14
as before said thought the whole thing was joke nothing	13.62
you are setting up an establishment of course why yes replied the	30.55
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is	18.06

well replied athos am not far from approving the idea of monsieur	23.66
the contract was read during profound	6.11
what then said the	18.67

it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on good	64.44
how do you think these garments fit me wonderfully said artagnan but come to offer you dress which will become you still	47.79

he will not return till the taking of the	17.93
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming	36.60

ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do poor devil	77.31
and you will leave me then	16.87
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people	46.77
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached	32.90
in few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps have not been missed at the	38.64
in case any evil should happen to me said	28.26
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count that it is who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de	35.39

then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of rock from which he had full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as water fowl ere it takes to the wing set	57.05

calmly drawing forth from his pocket small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in ring of admirable	57.96
franz albert and the count continued to descend the	9.38
this idea completely restored clemency to his	39.01
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its	108.63
key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was	22.82
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult	28.10
you must have received false report or you have gone	23.12
at about league and half from the city artagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing	42.67
globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting strong light into my chamber and perceived with terror that man was standing within few paces of	59.96
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers	17.09
he leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like man accustomed to the handling of his	40.09
listen returned artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall	52.75
be assured then of seeing me soon	12.39
to the installation of my rival	12.70

show him in said milady in quick tone but so piercing that artagnan heard her in the	20.93
zounds said porthos sobbing believe crying but how foolish all this is then they	50.35
oh it is proof that the lord is on our side felton replied	31.19
nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud he will spoil the	38.00
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow	31.89
take these documents then they do not concern	17.25

one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de	14.16
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen very simple gentleman had become an admirable	61.06
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the	19.57
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels come answer	22.47
that well madame and there is an old proverb that says traveling trains	30.92
musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round	18.97
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that had not committed that of which stood	29.89

my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers presse_ and débats_ within six steps of her for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within circle of four yards and you will	100.72
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers would make your	29.92
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this moment and sent my cutter to meet	68.34
and has he conformed to all that the letter specified he	12.91
oh my god said	12.22
raoul had offered some opposition at first but artagnan made use of the comte de la fere name and paying visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the	59.65
comminges then led the count to room on the ground floor of pavilion at the end of the	14.26
can understand that said	15.97
now said the baron look at this	9.10
but nothing escaped the count notice and he observed little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister	40.26
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy doctor and in psychology to amaze	64.00
as for you raoul am sure it is your fault some giddiness or	32.45
but monsieur de tréville is skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the	75.30
those are kind and cheering	24.88

the pickaxe struck for moment with dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of	34.42

yes that is the very boy he patronized by	34.71
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with	10.94
as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian	14.03

there came up from all nature in the dawn of day perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the	32.05
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at	27.90
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every	41.16
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced few paces to find comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you	55.40

porthos turned around like lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword but before it was out of the scabbard porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher	59.86

aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to artagnan whose senses were still in state of	30.74

meanwhile villefort and avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified	46.44
milady had sunk into chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible	37.14
on guard but said he whom artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey	67.30
adieu my charmer will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in better	36.37
said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful	27.74

desrues was however must confess more	16.91
ah thought artagnan the man am warned against by	12.80
it must be observed that as separate passage led to the first floor in which artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this	59.63

do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine	38.03

groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and	18.95
valentine arose placed chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went	60.13
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the	118.07

come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not	32.65
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with	20.38

the monk eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase will go and he	37.08

you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	27.96

bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it believe to political	30.81
who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with	19.14
but what is it to repeat these	19.66
cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned	49.09
ah indeed so much the better said lord de	24.89
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the	44.33

richelieu thought artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in	26.05
but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by	18.78
his hat was little napless his feather was little faded his gold lace was little tarnished his laces were trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome	60.31
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of	45.26
were you there then monsieur followed them from curiosity so that saw the combat without the combatants seeing	32.45

do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes	22.39
take care athos cried artagnan don you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only civilians very bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit	55.96
gentlemen said morcerf it is only quarter past ten and expect someone	27.48
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his	51.72
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed	35.12

she looked at him in	13.10
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before table his head buried in his hands his back being	49.50
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent	18.40
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her	30.88
ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau	39.61
is this carriage for us asked	21.13

about five clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its	30.07
but are there not thousand tortures by which man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is	97.21
artagnan advanced few steps into the	24.46
oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young lady eyes swam with	27.92
yes said	21.64
porthos devoured artagnan with wondering	9.42
cannot speak latin responded the	6.40
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might	74.43
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous	51.10
besides artagnan passed the evening with	6.03
then you pity me sincerely	9.75
are you prepared yes	12.54
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened	11.15
has he sent no particular message for me	23.29
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was	32.59

on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the	11.77

bravo an excellent	10.22
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by	32.17
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate	19.24
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into	31.20
some lackey murmured	15.94
eh pardieu said mazarin with grimace which he always made when spoken to about	29.82
ah why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned perfect stillness in the	54.96
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an	39.88
athos bowed and prepared to	14.13
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and have heard nothing of either of them	36.74
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in cargo which was to replace what had been	45.13
the porter was not yet gone to	11.35
and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to	70.45
madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly	29.87
oh murmured the count shall then be permitted to love again	15.56
then they must put horses to	20.21
do not forget for single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret	52.94

if his heart is free and he will marry haydée the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom have brought up with the love of father and who has shown the love and tenderness of daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last	51.18
the officer face expressed complete	9.32
come continued athos executioner do your	22.16
that reply led to several questions about the king capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished	58.71
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly will write	20.21
but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be	36.69
and have no inclination to	11.50
remember at later period and at certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was who came to seek you and that did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling	81.89
we will try and carry him on board the	17.09
the door opened and artagnan went into the	14.17
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him	39.79
oh oh said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post	31.87
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to	100.89
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and	14.69
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family	48.86
ah is there secret spring said	31.99
and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him	45.03
do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative	25.89
valentine poured the orangeade into glass and gave it to her grandmother with certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the	45.03
in the morning felton came as usual but milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing word to	51.09
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without	18.30
it was bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the	30.44
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his	21.25
unfortunately that is	8.87
shall be gone only few	15.62
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la	15.99
faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his	38.97
danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh	33.17
this time said athos first breaking the silence artagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at	47.70
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he	20.65
compression is needed to explode	44.83
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to	19.07
but his temper cooled down like his friend he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about	43.79
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is	33.55
he has been	28.99

and then and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and further promise you to be there as spectator of your	38.82
such as were only beautiful gave their beauty whence without doubt comes the proverb the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she	49.45
frightful frightful murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders little too late that confessor should be sent	51.99
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving generally you are only rude but tonight you are	18.90
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered	39.48
was looking around for porthos when saw near me head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black	80.37
god be praised and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still	33.24
what puritan you are said he that happens every	19.69

and have none either said the	8.63
andrea think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man was born for	44.73
but who is oh remember said	34.07

de tréville was highly astonished to see his make sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying blood he shall not escape me this time and who	60.95
you may see matters differently artagnan and think	26.51
there again monte cristo was assailed by multitude of	20.49
de salvieux who recommends him to me entreat your majesty to receive him	21.13
de tréville as nine clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task knocking was heard at the street	36.23
on honor what then is there surprising in that	17.49
these three others fenced against him with their agile	24.68
have you shown this letter to anyone asked villefort becoming still more	28.51
why does he go in secret is he afraid of me or of his father for am sure the count is his	26.93
if were monk should knock yonder and should have good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and	61.52
it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what	29.90
should andrea marry according to his father views he will perhaps give him one two or three	35.33
your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for	33.07
artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time villars cotterets was royal	32.65

bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand	35.36
the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched	25.11
positive feast	3.19
but monseigneur know nothing about them have never seen	25.61
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound	40.03
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify	43.39
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasant	31.68
owe to this worthy lord all the happiness ever	24.87
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to	44.72
leave him with me replied the	17.45
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent rendering such service madame replied artagnan have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty service and that shall only be happy the day lose it for	64.53
ah if you command me that another thing said	29.67

from dieppe no from	12.19
we will say no more about it	15.89
then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render	77.62
do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that am dependent on another who have always gained my own livelihood	77.99

on the eve of departure carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me	43.93
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the	92.04
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five	39.71
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come	21.18
and artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from	61.71
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to	57.84

porthos pretended to be	23.52
artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	13.32

one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless	39.26
it is for me then to interrogate	15.34
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on	12.28

if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied	44.78
the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed	28.12
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his	77.68
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like madman he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of	54.72
morrel unhappy exclaimed the	26.18
oh don doubt that replied artagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that wish to belong to the church and that avoid all mundane	107.15
but he said the count generosity is too overwhelming valentine will be satisfied with my humble	19.16
do you know monsieur artagnan he added looking steadfastly at the	20.20

it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same	20.77
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefort	67.41
then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her	24.82
athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which	44.12

their repast consisted apparently of bread and	14.71
the hapless dantès was	25.86
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she	85.82
glance was exchanged between athos and	10.13
artagnan smiled porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his	31.38
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other	15.85
am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant replied morcerf but am reluctantly obliged to confess have nothing further to communicate yes stay do know one thing more namely that she is musician for one day when chanced to be breakfasting with the count heard the sound of guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her	139.66

go on	277.84
yes you see am as exact as you	9.33
albert vented his anger on pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half mind to	79.10
cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious	36.15
this idea was one of vengeance to me and tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my	23.37
the cardinal is not the man to forget mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being certain young gascon of my	40.70

the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but artagnan who had no longer motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his	49.34
at this moment the coadjutor was announced cry of surprise ran through the royal	12.82

on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own	45.87
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	21.57
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of	37.13
